  introduction:
    AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. 
    Part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, OpenTelemetry provides open source APIs, libraries, and agents to collect 
    distributed traces and metrics for application monitoring. With AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your 
    applications just once to send correlated metrics and traces to multiple AWS and Partner monitoring solutions. Use 
    auto-instrumentation agents to collect traces without changing your code. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry also collects 
    metadata from your AWS resources and managed services, so you can correlate application performance data with underlying 
    infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution. Use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to instrument your 
    applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and Amazon Elastic 
    Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda, as well as on-premises.

    "AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry empowers you to implement broad yet efficient, secure yet flexible, observability
    solutions. It helps you optimize your production environments by ensuring predictable resource utilization, and
    can increase your analytical visibility while protecting your investment in standardized observability tools.
    It is backed by AWS Support, testing, and certification."

  useCases:
    AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry automates the deep collection and direct exposure of correlated application and infrastructure
    data needed for AWS monitoring and visualization services. Use cases include sending metrics and traces to AWS and
    third-party Partner monitoring services, automate collection of traces, collect metadata on application resources as well as
    collect, analyze, and alarm on application metrics in CloudWatch.

  openSource:
    We are proud to be a part of the OpenTelemetry developer community upstream. As part of the open source community, we
    follow an “upstream-first” approach where we contribute all our enhancements, changes and bug fixes upstream.
    Our open source distribution is built using this upstreamed code. We participate in the open standards discussions in
    the OpenTelemetry Specification SIG and W3C Tracing Specification.

  Introduction

  AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported
  distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. Part of the Cloud Native Computing
  Foundation (CNCF), OpenTelemetry provides open source APIs, libraries, and agents to
  collect distributed traces and metrics for application monitoring. With AWS Distro
  for OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your applications just once to send
  correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions and use auto-
  instrumentation agents to collect traces without changing your code. AWS Distro
  for OpenTelemetry also collects metadata from your AWS resources and
  managed services, so you can correlate application performance data with
  underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.
  Use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to instrument your applications running on
  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and
  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, and AWS Fargate, as well as on-
  premises.

  Benefits

  AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry empowers you to implement broad, while efficient, secure, while flexible, observability
  solutions. It helps you optimize your production environments by ensuring predictable resource utilization and it can
  sharpen your analytical expertise while protecting your investment in standardized observability tools. And even AWS Premium
  support is just a click away.

  Use Cases

  AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry automates the deep collection and direct exposure of correlated application and infrastructure
  data needed for AWS monitoring and visualization services.

  Open Source

  We are proud to be a part of the OpenTelemetry developer community upstream. As part of the community,
  AWS follows an upstream-first approach where all our enhancements are contributed upstream. Our
  distribution is built using this upstreamed code.
