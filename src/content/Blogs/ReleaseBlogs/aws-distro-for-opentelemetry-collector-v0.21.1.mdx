# Notice 

We are aware of a potential issue in the Go standard library prior to versions 1.18.6 and 1.19.1 (CVE-2022-27664) used by the AWS Distribution for 
Open Telemetry (ADOT) Collector prior to versions v0.20.1 and v0.21.1.
 
We have prepared new releases of the ADOT Collector, v0.20.1 and v0.21.1, using Go 1.18.6. There are no functional changes from ADOT Collector 
v0.20.0 or v0.21.0, respectively. We recommend that customers update their ADOT Collector to at least v0.20.1 or v0.21.1 at the earliest opportunity.  
See https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector for information on deploying the ADOT Collector.
