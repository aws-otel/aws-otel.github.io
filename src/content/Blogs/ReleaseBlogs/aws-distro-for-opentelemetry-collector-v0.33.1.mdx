# Notice

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) team has discovered an issue where ADOT Collector (aws-otel-collector) prints to stdout the content of the AOT_CONFIG_CONTENT environment variable, when the Collector starts up. This is a concern if that environment variable contains sensitive content.
We have fixed the issue by removing the log statement to avoid exposure of sensitive content. If you are using ADOT collector, and sets its configuration through the AOT_CONFIG_CONTENT environment variable,
we recommend you upgrade to either version [v0.32.1](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/releases/tag/v0.32.1) or [v0.33.1](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/releases/tag/v0.33.1)

**Release Highlights**

- Remove Logging for AOT_CONFIG_CONTENT
