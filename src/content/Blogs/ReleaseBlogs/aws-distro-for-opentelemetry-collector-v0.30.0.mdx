**Release Highlights**

* Fix permissions on potentially sensitive files in linux packaging scripts [\#2108](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/pull/2108) ([Aneurysm9](https://github.com/Aneurysm9))
* Fix: fix upstart style init script [\#2070](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/pull/2070) ([rapphil](https://github.com/rapphil))

**IMPORTANT:**

* [There are upstream breaking changes in prometheus related components](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.76.3) that affects metric names. The ADOT collector will adopt the upstream behaviour starting v0.31.0. For more details and testing instructions please refer to issue [#2043](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/issues/2043).
* The `aws.ecs.service.name` property is being set to `ServiceName` metadata in the case a collector with `awsecscontainermetricsreceiver` is running in ECS on EC2. For ECS on Fargate, `aws.ecs.service.name` is an empty string. Previously this value was always set to `"undefined"` for both EC2 and Fargate compute types.  [\#19744](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/19744) ([erichsueh3](https://github.com/erichsueh3))
