**Notice**

We are aware of a potential issue in the google.golang.org/grpc package (CVE-2023-44487), used by the AWS Distribution for Open Telemetry (ADOT) Collector up to and including v0.34.0.
We have a new release of the ADOT Collector, v0.35.0 updating packages affected by this vulnerability. We recommend that customers update their ADOT Collector
to at least v0.35.0 at the earliest opportunity. See https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector for information on deploying the ADOT Collector.
