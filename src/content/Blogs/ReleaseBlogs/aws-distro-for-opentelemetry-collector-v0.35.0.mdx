**Notice**

We are aware of a potential issue in the google.golang.org/grpc package (CVE-2023-44487), used by the AWS Distribution for Open Telemetry (ADOT) Collector up to and including v0.34.0.
We have a new release of the ADOT Collector, v0.35.0 updating packages affected by this vulnerability. We recommend that users update their ADOT Collector
to at least v0.35.0 at the earliest opportunity. See https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector for information on deploying the ADOT Collector.

**Upstream changelog**

* [OpenTelemetry Collector v0.87.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases/tag/v0.87.0)
* [OpenTelemetry Collector v0.88.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases/tag/v0.88.0)

**New Components**

The following feature gates are now enabled by default. The filelog receiver, filestorage extension, and AWS CloudwatchLogs exporter
can be used with no command line changes. The feature gate can still be used to disable the usage of these components in an ADOT
Collector configuration. 

`adot.receiver.filelog`
`adot.exporter.awscloudwatchlogs
`adot.extension.file_storage`
