# Notice

We are aware of a potential issue in the Go standard library prior to version 1.20.10, used by the AWS Distribution for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Collector up to and including v0.33.2. 
We have prepared a new release of the ADOT Collector, v0.33.3 using Go 1.20.10. There are no functional changes from the previous patch versions. 
We recommend that customers update their ADOT Collector to at least v0.33.3 at the earliest opportunity. See https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector for information on deploying the ADOT Collector.
