[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/) EKS Add-on v0.80.0-eksbuild.2 and v0.78.0-eksbuild.2 are now available.

<SectionSeparator />

**Release Highlights**

* The ADOT EKS Add on v0.80.0-eksbuild.2 and v0.78.0-eksbuild.2 fixes the build failure when creating the EKS add on using [advanced configuration for ADOT](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on/add-on-configuration).


The workaround to use advanced configuration for ADOT for v0.80.0-eksbuild.1 and v0.78.0-eksbuild.1 is

- Set “Preserve on cluster” and delete the EKS add-on for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
- Re-create the EKS add-on for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with the same settings.
