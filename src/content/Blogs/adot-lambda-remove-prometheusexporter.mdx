AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda announces removal of [prometheusexporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/prometheusexporter) from March 2023 Lambda layer release (v0.27.0) in favor of using [prometheusremotewriteexporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter/README.md) as the default exporter to send metrics to Prometheus.

We advise customers to change their collector configuration to use `prometheusremotewriteexporter` by the **end of March 2023**. The instructions to set the exporter are mentioned [in our documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/advanced-prometheus-remote-write-configurations#prometheus-remote-write-exporter-configurations) and in [upstream OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter/README.md#getting-started). If you have any questions on the migration to the new exporter, please feel free to [file an issue.](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-lambda/issues)
