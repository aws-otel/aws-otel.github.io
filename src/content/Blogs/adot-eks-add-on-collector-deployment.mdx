AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) for Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) add-ons has introduced the ability to deploy an ADOT Collector during add-on installation. You can learn how to install ADOT for EKS add-ons on your EKS cluster by following the [Getting Started with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry using EKS Add-Ons](/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on) guide.

Using the advanced configuration feature for EKS add-ons, customers can deploy a Collector to an AWS service of their choice, without the need to manage it themselves. Send traces to AWS X-Ray, or metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus or Amazon CloudWatch, with this extended functionality of ADOT for EKS add-ons.

To learn about how the EKS add-ons advanced configuration feature can be used for ADOT, see the [EKS add-ons Advanced Configuration for ADOT](/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on/add-on-configuration) section of the getting started guide. Visit the [EKS add-ons Advanced Configuration for ADOT: Collector Deployment](/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on/add-on-configuration-collector-deployment) section of the guide for more information on using the advanced configuration feature to deploy an ADOT Collector.
