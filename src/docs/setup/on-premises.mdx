In this tutorial, we will demonstrate installing  AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) binaries
for on-premises hosts. For supported platforms, see the [ADOT Collector README](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) on GitHub.

## Install the ADOT Collector
1. Set up the required [AWS credential file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
2. Logon your on-premise host and download ADOT Collector source code
from [AWS Observability GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) and build RPM file with the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector.git
make package-rpm
```
3. Install the ADOT Collector RPM by the following command on the host.
```
sudo rpm -Uvh ./aws-otel-collector.rpm
```
4. After RPM is installed, it will create ADOT Collector in directory `/opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/` with the
following folder layout.

5. After  ADOT Collector is installed on the host, the following commands can be used to start, stop, and check the running status.
    a) Start  ADOT Collector with CTL script. The config.yaml is optional; if itâ€™s not provided, the default
    [config](https://github.com/mxiamxia/aws-opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/config.yaml) is applied.
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c </path/config.yaml> -a start
    ```
    b) Stop  ADOT Collector process
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -a stop
    ```
    c) Check the status of ADOT Collector
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl  -a status
    ```
