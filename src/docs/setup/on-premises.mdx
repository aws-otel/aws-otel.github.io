In this tutorial, we will demonstrate installing  AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) binaries
for on-premises hosts. For supported platforms, see the [ADOT Collector README](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) on GitHub.

## Install the ADOT Collector
1. Set up the required [AWS credential file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
2. Logon your on-premise host and download ADOT Collector source code
from [AWS Observability GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) and build RPM file with the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector.git
make package-rpm
```
3. Install the ADOT Collector RPM by the following command on the host.
```
sudo rpm -Uvh ./aws-otel-collector.rpm
```
4. After RPM is installed, it will create  ADOT Collector in directory `/opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/` with the
following folder layout.

5. After  ADOT Collector is installed on the host, the following commands can be used to start, stop, and check the running status.
    a) Start  ADOT Collector with CTL script. The config.yaml is optional; if itâ€™s not provided, the default
    [config](https://github.com/mxiamxia/aws-opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/config.yaml) is applied.
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c </path/config.yaml> -a start
    ```
    b) Stop  ADOT Collector process
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -a stop
    ```
    c) Check the status of  ADOT Collector
    ```
    sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl  -a status
    ```

## Configure AWS IAM Roles Anywhere

AWS Introduced [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to allow 
workloads to obtain temporary security credentials in IAM. ADOT can leverage this service to obtain the credentials needed for
the exporters that target AWS (CloudWatch EMF, X-Ray, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus).

You can find details on the configuration of IAM Roles Anywhere in the launch [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/extend-aws-iam-roles-to-workloads-outside-of-aws-with-iam-roles-anywhere/). 

In the following instructions we assume IAM Roles Anywhere is configured and a Trust Anchor is established in your AWS account
and key pair and certificate are stored on the local machine.

It's [recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/trust-model.html#trust-policy) to include conditions 
in the trust policy using attributes from the X.509 certificate. For example the following trust policy restricts the actions by using
the certificate Subject Common Name (CN) attribute.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "rolesanywhere.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole",
                "sts:SetSourceIdentity",
                "sts:TagSession"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                "aws:PrincipalTag/x509Subject/CN": "VM01"
            }
        }            
        }
    ]
}
```


1. Install credential helper tool (`aws_signing_helper`) as instructed in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/credential-helper.html). Ensure the tool is included in the system PATH.

2. Create a home folder for the `aoc` user, copy the X509 certificate and private key.

    ```
    mkdir /home/aoc/.x509
    mv <x509_private_key> /home/aoc/.x509/private-key.pem
    mv <x509_certificate> /home/aoc/.x509/cert.pem
    chown -R aoc:aoc /home/aoc/.x509/

    echo "AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/home/aoc/.x509/config" | sudo tee -a /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/etc/.env
    ```

3. Create an AWS SDK configuration (`config`) to use credential helper tool to generate temporary credentials using the provided X509 key and certificate.
You'll need to provide the following values from your AWS Environment. You can find more information in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/credential-helper.html#credential-helper-options):

- `TA_ARN`: `--trust-anchor-arn` ARN of Trust anchor to to use for authentication.
- `PROFILE_ID_ARN`: `--profile-arn` ARN of the profile to pull policies from.
- `REMOTE_ROLE`: `--role-arn` Target role to assume.

Note that we stored the certificate and private keys in the `aoc` user home folder inside the `.x509` directory. If you use a different path
you'll need to update the configuration accordingly.

```
export TA_ARN=<Trust Anchor ARN>
export PROFILE_ID_ARN=<Profile ID ARN>
export REMOTE_ROLE=<Role ARN with AWS permission>

cat > config << EOF
[default]
credential_process = aws_signing_helper credential-process --certificate /home/aoc/.x509/cert.pem --private-key /home/aoc/.x509/private-key.pem --trust-anchor-arn $TA_ARN --profile-arn $PROFILE_ID_ARN --role-arn $REMOTE_ROLE
EOF

sudo chown aoc:aoc config
sudo mv config /home/aoc/.x509/
```

4. Add `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to the ADOT Collector configuration by adding an entry in the `.env` file used to load
the service. *Note that this file is only loaded for `systemd` enabled Linux distributions. For other systems you might need to make additional modifications to load the environment variable before running the service.*

```
echo "AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/home/aoc/.x509/config" | sudo tee -a /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/etc/.env
```

5. Restart the ADOT Collector to use the newly configured role.

```
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -a stop
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -a start
```
