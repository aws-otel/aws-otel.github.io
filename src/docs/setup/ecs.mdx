title: 'Setting up AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in Amazon Elastic Container Service'
description:
    In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to run AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (AWS Otel Collector) as a
    sidecar on the Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in Fargate and in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
    (Amazon EC2) mode. We provide a sample application within the same Amazon ECS task to send monitoring data to
    AWS OTel Collector.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to run AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (AWS Otel Collector) as a
sidecar on the Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in Fargate and in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) mode. We provide a sample application within the same Amazon ECS task to send monitoring data to AWS
OTel Collector.

## 1. Create a Cluster

If you don't have a cluster, follow this <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-cluster">tutorial</Link> to create a new one.

## 2. Setup the AWS OTel Collector

There are three different ways to get started by installing AWS OTel Collector as a sidecar in ECS- using CloudFormation template, using Task 
Definition, and using AWS Management Console. Follow any of the following three options to setup the collector.

### 2.1 Setup using CloudFormation template

The CloudFormation template will create all the necessary resources to get the Collector ready. This option is recommended for the beginners 
who are new to ECS.

- <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/cfn-for-ecs-fargate">Deploy AOT for ECS on Fargate</Link> 

### 2.2 Setup using ECS Task Definition
        
This option is recommended for developers who are familier with ECS and know how to run a task using a given task definition.

### 2.3 Setup using AWS Management Console

This option shows the whole process step by step to setup AWS OTel Collector using AWS Management Console.

**Note:**
After you finished the tutorial, remember to shut down the new ECS cluster created in the tutorial in order to avoid any charges.
