title: 'Run ADOT Collector Examples with Docker'
description:
    This example will introduce how to install ADOT Collector to collect metrics/traces data from a sample application running in
    the Docker container. The sample application will generate Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP) format based metrics and
    traces data and send to AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray consoles. Please follow the steps below to try ADOT Collector.

This example will introduce how to install ADOT Collector to collect metrics/traces data from a sample application running in the
Docker container. The sample application will generate Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP) format based metrics and traces data
and send to AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray consoles.

Please follow the steps below to try ADOT Collector.

## Prerequisite
1. To retrieve your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` for the following example, please see
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for setting up your AWS credentials.
2. Installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) runtime on your laptop.

## Steps
1. Download the source code in this [repo](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) and enter into `examples` folder.
Open and Edit `docker-compose.yaml` file with the expected `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` in the section below.
The region is where the data will be sent to.

(**Note,** if you canâ€™t access the repo, you can download `docker-compose.yaml` file at
[here](https://github.com/aws-otel/aws-otel.github.io/blob/main/src/docs/docker-compose.mdx) and edit
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` with the expected values.

```yaml
image: amazon/aws-otel-collector:latest
command: ["--config=/etc/otel-agent-config.yaml"]
environment:
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<to_be_added>
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<to_be_added>
  - AWS_REGION=<to_be_added>
volumes:
  - ../config.yaml:/etc/otel-agent-config.yaml // use default config
  - ~/.aws:/home/aoc/.aws
ports:
  - "1777:1777"   # pprof extension
  - "55679:55679" # zpages extension
  - "4317:4317" # OTLP receiver
  - "13133"       # health_check
```

2. Once AWS credential has been updated in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, run the following command within the same folder where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is located.
```
cd examples; docker-compose up -d
```

3. Once ADOT Collector and Sample application docker images are up and running. We can check the monitoring data in CloudWatch and X-Ray consoles.

4. CloudWatch Metrics console - (AOCDockerDemo/AOCDockerDemoService)

5. AWS X-Ray Console

6. To stop this demo with ADOT Collector, please run the following command.
```
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```
