1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**

Letâ€™s go to CloudWatch console and select Log groups from the left side navigation. Search for our log group
name `/aws/ecs/application/metrics`  and then click the log stream name which defined before.
We should see our expected (following) metrics. These logs use the CloudWatch [Embedded Metric
Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html) (EMF)
to generate CloudWatch Metrics. We sent `statsdTestMetric:1|c` once a second and the aggregation time is 60s, we should see the value
around to 60
Following is an example for received logs in the CloudWatch console.
