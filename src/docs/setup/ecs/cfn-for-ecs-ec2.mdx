In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to run OpenTelemetry Collector (AWS Otel Collector) as a sidecar on the
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) mode. We provide sample
applications within the same Amazon ECS task to send monitoring data to AWS OTel Collector.

To Install AWS OTel Collector by using CloudFormation, you have to have a cluster.
If you are not famaliar with how to create a cluster, you can check this <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-cluster">create-cluster</Link>
section.

### Setup for ECS EC2
1. Download the CloudFormation template file for installing AWS OTel Collector for ECS EC2. Run the following curl command.
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/main/deployment-template/ecs/aws-otel-ec2-sidecar-deployment-cfn.yaml
```
2. Replace the <PATH_TO_CloudFormation_TEMPLATE> with the path where your template saved in the command, and export the
   following parameters, and then run CloudFormation command.
    * `Cluster_Name` - ECS Cluster name setup in Prerequisite step
    * `AWS_Region` - Region the data will be sent
    * `PATH_TO_CloudFormation_TEMPLATE` - CFN template path downloaded in Step 1
    * `command` -  Assign value to the command variable to select the config file path; the AWS collector comes with
                   two configs baked in for ECS customers (choose one of them based on your requirements):
                   `--config=/etc/ecs/otel-agent-ecs-default-config.yaml` - To consome OTPL metrics/traces and X-Ray SDK traces (custom application metrics/traces)
                   `--config=/etc/ecs/container-insights/otel-task-metrics-config.yaml` - To Use OTPL, Xray and Container Resource utilization metrics
```console lineNumbers=true
ClusterName=<Cluster_Name>
Region=<AWS_Region>
command=<command>
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name AOCECS-${ClusterName}-${Region} \
    --template-body file://<PATH_TO_CloudFormation_TEMPLATE> \
    --parameters ParameterKey=ClusterName,ParameterValue=${ClusterName} \
                 ParameterKey=CreateIAMRoles,ParameterValue=True \
                 ParameterKey=command,ParameterValue=${command} \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
    --region ${Region}
```
3. Go to you ECS Console and see if the task is running.
4. Go to the <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs#3-results">Results</Link> section to learn how to check the collected metrics and traces.
