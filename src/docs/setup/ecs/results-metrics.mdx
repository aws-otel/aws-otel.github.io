1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**

Letâ€™s go to CloudWatch console and select Log groups from the left side navigation. Search for our log group 
name `/aws/ecs/containerinsights/{ClusterName}/performance`  and then click the log stream name which is your `task_id`. 
We should see our expected (following) metrics. These logs use the CloudWatch [Embedded Metric 
Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html) (EMF) 
to generate CloudWatch Metrics. Following is an example for received logs in the CloudWatch console.
