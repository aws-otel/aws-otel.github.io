If you selected the EC2 as your launch Type when you created your task definition, you can just select 
EC2 as your Launch type. Select the cluster you want to use and click the **Run Task** button.

3. You can go to the cluster to see the task running. Visit the <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs#3-results">Results</Link>  section to check the collected metrics and traces.
