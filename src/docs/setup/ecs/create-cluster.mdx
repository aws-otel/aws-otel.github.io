title: 'Setting up AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in Amazon Elastic Container Service'
description:
    In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to run AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (AWS Otel Collector) as a
    sidecar on the Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in Fargate and in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
    (Amazon EC2) mode. We provide a sample application within the same Amazon ECS task to send monitoring data to
    AWS OTel Collector.
