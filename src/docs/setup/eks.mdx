title: 'Setting up AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service'
description:
    In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to run the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry(ADOT Collector) Collector as
    sidecar on the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Sidecar is a microservices design pattern where a
    companion service runs next to your primary microservice, augmenting its abilities or intercepting resources it is
    utilizing. We recommend deploying ADOT Collector on Amazon EKS as a sidecar, defining it in the same task
    definition as your application.

## Create IAM policy
For the required permissions and setup,
see the <Link to="/docs/setup/permissions">Permissions</Link> section.

<SectionSeparator />

## Attach the EKS-AWSObservability IAM Policy to worker node
1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
2. Select one of the worker node instances and choose the IAM role in the description.
3. On the IAM role page, choose **Attach policies**.
4. In the list of policies, select the check box next to `AWSDistroOpenTelemetryPolicy`. You can use the search box to find this policy.
5. Choose **Attach policies**.

## Deploy ADOT Collector on Amazon EKS as sidecar
Sidecar is a microservice design pattern where a companion service runs next to your primary microservice, augmenting its
abilities or intercepting resources it is utilizing. We recommend deploying ADOT Collector on Amazon EKS as a sidecar,
defining it in the same task definition as your application. This allows the ADOT Collector to collect the metric and
trace data for the application.

1. Create a Kubernetes namespace.
```
kubectl create namespace aws-otel-eks
```
2. An example configuration template can be found under [examples here](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/examples/eks/aws-cloudwatch/otel-sidecar.yaml) in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector GitHub Repo.
  * In this example you can replace [image](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/examples/eks/aws-cloudwatch/otel-sidecar.yaml#L41) with ADOT Collector Docker image you built
(Ex:`amazon/aws-otel-collector:latest`), and `AWS_REGION` with the name of the region where the logs are published (Ex: `us-west-2`).

3. Deploy the application.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/main/examples/eks/aws-cloudwatch/otel-sidecar.yaml
```
4. View the resources in the `aws-otel-eks` namespace.
```
kubectl get all -n aws-otel-eks
```
<img src={img11} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

5. View the details of the deployed deployment.

```
kubectl -n aws-otel-eks describe deployment aws-otel-eks-sidecar
```

<img src={img12} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

The example template runs the ADOT Collector as a sidecar to send application metrics and traces on Amazon EKS.
We run two applications: the main application (`aws-otel-emitter`) and the ADOT Collector (`aws-otel-collector`).
After the setup is finished, we should see the following sample metrics in Amazon CloudWatch console.

**Note** :
After youâ€™ve finished the tutorial, remember to shut down the new EKS cluster created in the tutorial in order to avoid additional charges.
