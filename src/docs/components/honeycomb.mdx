title: 'Connecting to Honeycomb with the AWS Collector'
description:
    Honeycomb is a powerful observability tool that helps you debug your entire production app stack. Honeycomb supports several contributors to the OTEL project. Honeycomb can receive your OpenTelemetry data directly from AWS.

Honeycomb supports OpenTelemetry by ingesting OTLP directly, so users of
the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry can send tracing data directly to Honeycomb
without the need for extra exporters or other plugins.

## Configuration

Before you can use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb, you should 
[sign up for a Honeycomb account](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup). Once you
have an account, you can use your API key and choose a name for your dataset.
This will be included in the collector exporter configuration:

```yaml
# Honeycomb collector configuration
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: api.honeycomb.io:443
    headers:
      # You can find your Honeycomb authentication token at https://ui.honeycomb.io/account
      "x-honeycomb-team":"<YOUR_API_KEY>"
      # You can use any string for your dataset name, it will be created if it doesn't exist.
      "x-honeycomb-dataset": "<YOUR_DATASET_NAME>"
```
