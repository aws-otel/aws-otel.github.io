An exporter is a component in the OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) configured
to send data to different systems/back-ends. Different exporters converts
[OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md)
formatted data to their respective predefined back-end format  and exports this data to be interpreted by the back-end or system.

<SectionSeparator />

## OTLP Protocol

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md)
(OTLP) defines the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate processes such
as collectors and telemetry backends. OTLP is a protocol based on requests and responses, for example the client sends requests and the
server corresponds with responses. OTLP is currently implemented over two types of transport systems, gRPC and HTTP, specifying the
[Protocol Buffers schema](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (protobuf) used for the payloads. The protobuf
schema of the messages is the same for OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### OTLP/HTTP

The OTLP implementation transport system over HTTP uses protobuf payloads either in binary format or JSON. OTLP/HTTP uses HTTP POST
requests to send telemetry data from clients to servers. Implementations may use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 transports, if an HTTP/2 connection
cannot be established it should fallback to HTTP/1.1 transport.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### OTLP/gRPC

OTLP/gRPC sends telemetry data with unary requests in `ExportTraceServiceRequest` for traces, `ExportMetricsServiceRequest` for metrics,
`ExportLogsServiceRequest` for logs. The language independent interface types for these mentioned pipeline data can be found
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto). The client will continuously send sequences of requests to the server
and expects to receive a response with each request. You can learn more about the OTLP protocol
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md).

## Setting up A Monitoring Backend

OpenTelemetry can export traces, logs, and metrics to various backends to analyze in order to understand an application’s performance
and behavior. There are multiple monitoring backends (also known as end-points) which can support OpenTelemetry using the OTLP protocol.

In this section, we share getting started configurations to the Collector to export telemetry data to **AppDynamics, Honeycomb, Lightstep, New Relic, and SumoLogic** end-points.

<SectionSeparator />

## Prerequisites

For using any backends supported by OpenTelemetry, make sure you have set up the [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

<SectionSeparator />

## AppDynamics

AppDynamics supports OpenTelemetry by ingesting OTLP directly, so users of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) can send tracing data directly to 
AppDynamics without the need for additional plugins or non-OTLP exporters.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Requirements

Before you can use the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with the AppDynamics endpoint, you need AppDynamics SaaS Controller >= v21.2.0.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Configuration (Collector)

The configuration takes place in the OTLP exporter in the Collector config YAML file.

* Set the OTLP endpoint through the [OTLP HTTP Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/master/exporter/otlphttpexporter). To configure your AppDynamics Controller to work with the ADOT Collector, edit your `otel-config.yml` configuration file.
* Set the AppDynamics API key `<x-api-key>` (Your AppDynamics API key must be defined as an HTTP header. To obtain your unique x-api-key, you should work closely with your AppDynamics account team.)
* Use resource attributes to add your AppDynamics account information:
    * `appdynamics.controller.account`: Your AppDynamics Controller account name.
    * `appdynamics.controller.host`: your AppDynamics Controller host name.
    * `appdynamics.controller.port`: your AppDynamics Controller port number.
    * `service.name` your AppDynamics tier name. trace resource attribute for every service being monitored.
    * `service.namespace`: your AppDynamics application name. Set corresponding `service.namespace` trace resource attribute for every service being monitored.

For custom attributes, see [Ingest OpenTelemetry Trace Data](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO21/Ingest+OpenTelemetry+Trace+Data)

## Grafana Labs

### Grafana Cloud Agent

The Grafana Cloud Agent is an all-in-one agent for collecting metrics, logs,
and traces, built on top of production-ready open source software. The
batteries-included nature removes the need to install more than one piece of
software by including common integrations for monitoring out of the box.
Through our native integrations with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and
OpenMetrics, we ensure full compatibility with the complete CNCF ecosystem
while adding extra functionality for scaling collection.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Requirements

Dependencies:

* OpenTelemetry-Collector
* Prometheus
* Cortex
* Loki

Runtime requirements:

* ETCD or Consul for scaling functionality

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file with the following contents to configure the
Agent to collect metrics a Prometheus- or OpenMetrics-compatible endpoint:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
prometheus:
  # Configures where scraped metric data will be stored. Data read from this
  # directory will be forwarded using the configured remote_write settings.
  # this directory
  wal_directory: /tmp/agent
  configs:
    # An invidiual config here identifies a single Prometheus instance. Each
    # instance holds its own set of scrape jobs and remote_write settings. The
    # name specified here must be unique.
    - name: primary
      scrape_configs:
        # A job is responsible for discovering a set of targets to scrape.
        # static_configs specifies a static list of host:port pairs to use
        # as targets. Replace "host:port" below with the hostname and port
        # number of the OpenMetrics-compatible endpoint to collect metrics
        # from.
        - job_name: collect
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['host:port']
      # remote_write configures where to send metrics using the Prometheus
      # Remote Write format. If authentication is used, replace USERNAME and
      # password accordingly. Otherwise, omit the basic_auth block.
      remote_write:
        - url: REMOTE_WRITE_URL
          basic_auth:
            username: USERNAME
            password: PASSWORD
```

Integrations may be enabled to also collect metrics from common systems. Add the
following block to your configuration file:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
integrations:
  # Enable the "node_exporter" integration, which runs
  # https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter in-process and scrapes metrics
  # from it.
  node_exporter:
    enabled: true
  # Configured identically to remote_write from the previous section. This
  # section must exist if integrations are used.
  prometheus_remote_write:
    - url: REMOTE_WRITE_URL
      basic_auth:
        username: USERNAME
        password: PASSWORD
```

Log support may be added by adding a `loki` block. Use the following code block
to collect all log files from `/var/log`:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
loki:
  positions:
    # Configures where to store byte offsets of recently read files.
    filename: /tmp/positions.yaml
  clients:
    # Configures the location to send logs using the Loki write API.
    # If authentication is not needed, omit the basic_auth block.
    - url: LOKI_URL
      basic_auth:
        username: USERNAME
        password: PASSWORD
  scrape_configs:
  # Configures a scrape job to find log files to collect from. Targets
  # must be set to localhost.
  #
  # __path__ may be set to any glob-patterned filepath where log files are
  # stored.
  - job_name: varlogs
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - localhost
        labels:
          __path__: /var/log/*log
```

Support for collecting traces may be added with a `tempo` block. Use the
following code block to collect spans and forward them to an OTLP-compatible
endpoint:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
tempo:
  receivers:
    # Configure jaeger support. grpc supports spans over port
    # 14250, thrift_binary over 6832, thrift_compact over 6831,
    # and thrift_http over 14268. Specific port numbers may be
    # customized within the config for the protocol.
    jaeger:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        thrift_binary:
        thrift_compact:
        thrift_http:
    # Configure opencensus support. Spans can be sent over port 55678
    # by default.
    opencensus:
    # Configure otlp support. Spans can be sent to port 4317 by
    # default.
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        http:
    # Configure zipkin support. Spans can be sent to port 9411 by
    # default.
    zipkin:

  # Configures where to send collected spans and traces. Outgoing spans are sent
  # in the OTLP format. Replace OTLP_ENDPOINT with the host:port of the target
  # OTLP-compatible host. If the OTLP endpoint uses authentication, configure
  # USERNAME and PASSWORD accordingly. Otherwise, omit the basic_auth section.
  push_config:
    endpoint: OTLP_ENDPOINT
    basic_auth:
      username: USERNAME
      password: PASSWORD
```
