An exporter is a component in the OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) configured
to send data to different systems/back-ends. Different exporters converts
[OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md)
formatted data to their respective predefined back-end format  and exports this data to be interpreted by the back-end or system.

<SectionSeparator />

## OTLP Protocol

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md)
(OTLP) defines the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate processes such
as collectors and telemetry backends. OTLP is a protocol based on requests and responses, for example the client sends requests and the
server corresponds with responses. OTLP is currently implemented over two types of transport systems, gRPC and HTTP, specifying the
[Protocol Buffers schema](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (protobuf) used for the payloads. The protobuf
schema of the messages is the same for OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### OTLP/HTTP

The OTLP implementation transport system over HTTP uses protobuf payloads either in binary format or JSON. OTLP/HTTP uses HTTP POST
requests to send telemetry data from clients to servers. Implementations may use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 transports, if an HTTP/2 connection
cannot be established it should fallback to HTTP/1.1 transport.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### OTLP/gRPC

OTLP/gRPC sends telemetry data with unary requests in `ExportTraceServiceRequest` for traces, `ExportMetricsServiceRequest` for metrics,
`ExportLogsServiceRequest` for logs. The language independent interface types for these mentioned pipeline data can be found
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto). The client will continuously send sequences of requests to the server
and expects to receive a response with each request. You can learn more about the OTLP protocol
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md).

## Setting up A Monitoring Backend

OpenTelemetry can export traces, logs, and metrics to various backends to analyze in order to understand an application’s performance
and behavior. There are multiple monitoring backends (also known as end-points) which can support OpenTelemetry using the OTLP protocol.

In this section, we share getting started configurations to the Collector to export telemetry data to **AppDynamics, Honeycomb, Lightstep, New Relic, and SumoLogic** end-points.

<SectionSeparator />

## Prerequisites

For using any backends supported by OpenTelemetry, make sure you have set up the [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

<SectionSeparator />

## AppDynamics

AppDynamics supports OpenTelemetry by ingesting OTLP directly, so users of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) can send tracing data directly to 
AppDynamics without the need for additional plugins or non-OTLP exporters.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Requirements

Before you can use the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with the AppDynamics endpoint, you need AppDynamics SaaS Controller >= v21.2.0.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Configuration (Collector)

The configuration takes place in the OTLP exporter in the Collector config YAML file.

* Set the OTLP endpoint through the [OTLP HTTP Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/master/exporter/otlphttpexporter). To configure your AppDynamics Controller to work with the ADOT Collector, edit your `otel-config.yml` configuration file.
* Set the AppDynamics API key `<x-api-key>` (Your AppDynamics API key must be defined as an HTTP header. To obtain your unique x-api-key, you should work closely with your AppDynamics account team.)
* Use resource attributes to add your AppDynamics account information:
    * `appdynamics.controller.account`: Your AppDynamics Controller account name.
    * `appdynamics.controller.host`: your AppDynamics Controller host name.
    * `appdynamics.controller.port`: your AppDynamics Controller port number.
    * `service.name` your AppDynamics tier name. trace resource attribute for every service being monitored.
    * `service.namespace`: your AppDynamics application name. Set corresponding `service.namespace` trace resource attribute for every service being monitored.

For custom attributes, see [Ingest OpenTelemetry Trace Data](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO21/Ingest+OpenTelemetry+Trace+Data)
