    An exporter is a component in the OpenTelemetry Collector configured to send data to different systems/back-ends. Different

An exporter is a component in the OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) configured 
to send data to different systems/back-ends. Different exporters converts 
[OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md) 
formatted data to their respective predefined back-end format  and exports this data to be interpreted by the back-end or system.

## OTLP Protocol

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md) 
(OTLP) defines the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate processes such 
as collectors and telemetry backends. OTLP is a protocol based on requests and responses, for example the client sends requests and the 
server corresponds with responses. OTLP is currently implemented over two types of transport systems, gRPC and HTTP, specifying the 
[Protocol Buffers schema](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (protobuf) used for the payloads. The protobuf 
schema of the messages is the same for OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### OTLP/HTTP

The OTLP implementation transport system over HTTP uses protobuf payloads either in binary format or JSON. OTLP/HTTP uses HTTP POST 
requests to send telemetry data from clients to servers. Implementations may use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 transports, if an HTTP/2 connection 
cannot be established it should fallback to HTTP/1.1 transport.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### OTLP/gRPC

OTLP/gRPC sends telemetry data with unary requests in `ExportTraceServiceRequest` for traces, `ExportMetricsServiceRequest` for metrics, 
`ExportLogsServiceRequest` for logs. The language independent interface types for these mentioned pipeline data can be found 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto). The client will continuously send sequences of requests to the server 
and expects to receive a response with each request. You can learn more about the OTLP protocol 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md).

## Setting up A Monitoring Backend 

OpenTelemetry can export traces, logs, and metrics to various backends to analyze in order to understand an application’s performance 
and behavior. There are multiple monitoring backends (also known as end-points) which can support OpenTelemetry using the OTLP protocol. 

In this section, we will getting started configurations to the Collector to export telemetry data to **Honeycomb, Lightstep, and SumoLogic** end-points.

<SectionSeparator />

## Prerequisites

For using any backends supported by OpenTelemetry, make sure you have set up the [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

<SectionSeparator />

## Honeycomb

Honeycomb supports OpenTelemetry by ingesting OTLP directly, so users of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) can send tracing data directly to 
Honeycomb without the need for additional plugins or non-OTLP exporters.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Requirements

Before you can use the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with the Honeycomb end-point, you need:

* You will need a Honeycomb account, if you don’t currently have one you can sign up [here](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup).
* In your Honeycomb account, choose a name for your dataset and use your API key.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Configuration (Collector)

The configuration will take place in the OTLP exporter in the Collector config YAML file.

* Set the OTLP endpoint to [api.honeycomb.io:443](http://api.honeycomb.io:443/)
* Add your Honeycomb access token as an OTLP header (you can find your API token [here](https://ui.honeycomb.io/account))

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Example 

```yaml lineNumbers=true highlight={7,9}
# Honeycomb Collector configuration
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: api.honeycomb.io:443
    headers:
      # You can find your Honeycomb authentication token at https://ui.honeycomb.io/account
      "x-honeycomb-team":"<YOUR_API_KEY>"
      # You can use any string for your dataset name, it will be created if it doesn't exist.
      "x-honeycomb-dataset": "<YOUR_DATASET_NAME>"
```

<SubSectionSeparator />

## Support 

If you have any trouble using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb, you can reach out to the ADOT support team 
or directly to the [Honeycomb support page](https://www.honeycomb.io/support/). 

<SectionSeparator />

## Lightstep

Lightstep supports OpenTelemetry natively, via OTLP. If you’re already set up with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, then 
getting data into Lightstep only requires an edit to the YAML config file for the Collector to get started.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Requirements

Before you can use the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with Lightstep, you need:

* A Lightstep account. If you don't already have one, you can create a free account [here](https://app.lightstep.com/signup/developer?signup_source=awsdoc).
* An access token for your Lightstep project. This can be found in project settings (the gear icon in the sidebar).

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Configuration (Collector)

The configuration will take place in the OTLP exporter in the Collector config YAML file.

* Configure the Collector to export OTLP.
* Set the OTLP endpoint to point to Lightstep.
    * Public endpoint: [ingest.lightstep.com:443](http://ingest.lightstep.com:443/)
    * Private satellites: the address of your satellite load balancer.
* Add your Lightstep access token as an OTLP header.
    * Header name: "lightstep-access-token"

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Example 

```yaml lineNumbers=true highlight={8}
# Lightstep Collector configuration
exporters:
  otlp:
     # NOTE: if you are using private satellites, replace this public
     # endpoint with the address of your satellite load balancer.
    endpoint: ingest.lightstep.com:443
     # Your access token can be found in the project settings page
    headers: {"lightstep-access-token":"<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"}
```

## SumoLogic 

Sumo Logic supports telemetry signals from OpenTelemetry natively via OTLP.  If you’re already set up with AWS Distro for 
OpenTelemetry, then exporting data into a SumoLogic backend is as simple as editing your YAML config file for the Collector 
and getting started.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Requirements

Before you can use the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with Sumologic you need:

* A Sumologic account. If you don't already have one, you can create an account [here](https://www.sumologic.com/sign-up/mon/).
* An access token for your Sumologic project. This can be found [here](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Security/Access-Keys).

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Configuration (Collector)

The configuration will take place in the OTLP exporter in the Collector config YAML file.

* Configure the Collector to export OTLP. There are separate endpoints for HTTP and gRPC:
    * OTLP gRPC: `collection-sumologic-otelcol.sumologic:55680`
    * OTLP HTTP: `collection-sumologic-otelcol.sumologic:55681/v1/trace`
* An accessId and access Key for your SumoLogic project. This can be generated [here](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Security/Access-Keys).

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Example

```yaml lineNumbers=true highlight={7}
# SumoLogic Collector configuration
exporters:
  otlp:
    # NOTE: set the endpoint with the expected protocol
    # this is an example for gRPC, different endpoints are
    # required for different protocols
    endpoint: collection-sumologic-otelcol.sumologic:55680
    # You can generate your accessID and accessKey in your account settings
    headers: {"<accessId>:<accessKey>"}
```

If you are instrumenting your application using OpenTelemetry JavaScript, Java, Python, Go,  Ruby, .NET you can use the SumoLogic 
[documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/Traces/Getting_Started_with_Transaction_Tracing/Set_up_traces_collection_for_Kubernetes_environments#direct-connection-to-the-collector-recommended) 
to set up your application to connect with a SumoLogic backend.
