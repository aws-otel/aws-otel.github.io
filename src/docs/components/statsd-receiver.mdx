StatsD receiver is an agent that collects [StatsD metrics](https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md)
and does the [aggregation](#aggregation) for a customer defined interval (default value is 60s). The aggregation interval is similar to the flush
interval in StatsD. You can send counters, gauges and timer/histogram to StatsD receiver, which will send the aggregated metrics to the following workflow.
For example, you can use EMF exporter to send the metrics to CloudWatch.

StatsD receiver currently supports counter, gauge and timer/histogram types. The StatsD receiver can be used as a replacement of CloudWatch agent StatsD plugin for StatsD/dogStatsD.

## Enabling StatsD Receiver

To enable the StatsD receiver, add the name under the receiver section in the config file `(local/config.yaml)`.
By default, the receiver listens address `localhost:8125`, collects all metrics and aggregate the metrics in 60s.
The `transport` can only be udp.
(For the full list of metrics, see [Available Metrics](#available-metrics)).

The following configuration collects StatsD metrics by using StatsD receiver and sends
them to CloudWatch using `awsemf` exporter. You can set these configuration values to what works
for your application. Check out [SETUP](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/ecs) section for
configuring AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in Amazon Elastic Container Service.

## Available Metrics

### General format:

`<name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample-rate>|#<tag1-key>:<tag1-value>,<tag2-k/v>`

### Counter

`<name>:<value>|c|@<sample-rate>|#<tag1-key>:<tag1-value>`

It supports sample rate.

### Gauge

`name>:<value>|g|@<sample-rate>|#<tag1-key>:<tag1-value>`

Sample rate is not supported for gauges.

### Timer

`<name>:<value>|ms|@<sample-rate>|#<tag1-key>:<tag1-value>`

It supports sample rate.

`timer_histogram_mapping` is the configuration for timer/histogram. For `statsd_type`, you could choose `timer`, `timing` or `histogram`. For `observer_type`, you could choose `gauge`. When choosing `gauge`,
StatsD receiver will send the timer/histogram metric to the downstream component as OTLP gauge without doing any aggregation.

### Histogram
`<name>:<value>|h|@<sample-rate>|#<tag1-key>:<tag1-value>`

It supports sample rate.

`timer_histogram_mapping` is the configuration for timer/histogram. For `statsd_type`, you could choose `timer`, `timing` or `histogram`. For `observer_type`, you could choose `gauge`. When choosing `gauge`,
StatsD receiver will send the timer/histogram metric to the downstream component as OTLP gauge without doing any aggregation.

## Aggregation

You can set the aggregation interval using configuration parameter: `aggregation_interval`.
The examples below mean receiving metrics in the same interval.

### Counter

#### Example one:

`statsdTestMetric1:3000|c|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:4000|c|#mykey:myvalue`

result: get the value after incrementation: 7000 (3000+4000). For counter, the same metric with different value in
an interval will be incremented.

#### Example two:

`statsdTestMetric1:3000|c|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:20|c|@0.25|#mykey:myvalue`

result: get the value after incrementation with sample rate: 3080 (3000+20/0.25). For counter, the sample rate will be
calculated.

### Gauge

#### Example one:
`statsdTestMetric1:500|g|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:400|g|#mykey:myvalue`

result: get the latest value: 400. For gauge, the newest value will cover the early value.

#### Example two:
`statsdTestMetric1:500|g|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:+2|g|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:-1|g|#mykey:myvalue`

result: get the value after calculation: 501. For gauge, it supports plus and minus for aggregation.

### Timer
#### Example one(use `observer_type` as `gauge`):
`statsdTestMetric1:500|ms|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:400|ms|#mykey:myvalue`

result: send two OTLP gauge metrics to the downstream component. The first one has the value 500, the second one has the value 400.

### Histogram
#### Example one(use `observer_type` as `gauge`):
`statsdTestMetric1:500|h|#mykey:myvalue` `statsdTestMetric1:400|h|#mykey:myvalue`

result: send two OTLP gauge metrics to the downstream component. The first one has the value 500, the second one has the value 400.

## other Configuration Parameters

### `enable_metric_type`
The default value is false, enable the statsd receiver to be able to emit the metric type(gauge, counter, timer(in the future), histogram(in the future)) as a label.

#### Example:
`statsdTestMetric1:500|g|#mykey:myvalue` with `enable_metric_type: true` will add `metric_type: gauge` label to the downstream.
