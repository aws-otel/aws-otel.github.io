title: 'Confmap providers - Get configuration from different sources'
description: |
    Confmap represents the raw configuration for the OpenTelemetry Collector. A Confmap provider
    is a Collector component that provides configuration retrieved from a URI to configure the collector.
    This section will describe all the confmap providers supported by the ADOT collector.

The confmap providers are a type of OpenTelemetry collector component that is responsible by fetching configuration
from a URI. This configuration is be used to configure the Collector and all the other components. The URI for the confmap
providers is passed through the `-c/--config` command line parameter of the collector. The URI has the following format:
`<scheme>:<opaque data>`.

More technical details about this component can be found [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/confmap/README.md).

## Confmap providers supported by the ADOT collector

The ADOT collector support the following types of confmap providers: file, env, yaml, http, https and s3.


### File provider

* scheme: `file`. Scheme is optional in the file provider and can be omitted when passing this as parameter.
* description: Retrieves configuration from the local file system
* examples:
  * `/path/to/configuration.yaml`
  * `file:/path/to/configuration.yaml`
  * `c:\path\to\configuration.yaml`
  * `file:c:\path\to\configuration.yaml`

### Env provider

* scheme: `env`. Scheme is optional.
* description: Retrieves configuration from an environment variable.
* examples:
  * `env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME`

### YAML provider

* scheme: `yaml`
* description: Retrieves configuration directly from the command line, in yaml format.
* examples:
  * `yaml:processors::batch::timeout: 2s`

### HTTP provider

* scheme: `http`
* description: Retrieves configuration from an http server.
* examples:
  * `http://server/path/to/config.yaml`

### HTTPS provider

* scheme: `https`
* description: Retrieves configuration from an https server. It uses the certificate pool in the operating system to validate the hostname.
* examples:
  * `https://server/path/to/config.yaml`

### S3 provider

* scheme: `s3`
* description: Retrieves configuration from AWS s3. This component uses the [default credentials chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials) to authenticate in s3 in order to fetch the configuration.
* examples:
  * `s3://<bucket_name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/path/to/config.yaml`

## Passing command line parameters to the collector

When installing the ADOT collector in EC2 from a RPM or MSI, you can pass the configuration parameter to a control
script that is responsible by managing the Operating system service that run the ADOT collector. Control scripts support
the following confmap providers: file, http, https and s3.

### Linux


On Linux, to use any of the supported confmap providers, you can use the `-c` parameter of the the `aws-otel-collector-ctl` control script.

```
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c <configuration uri> -a start"
```

Here are some examples:

```bash
# File provider
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c /path/to/file.yaml -a start
# HTTP provider
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c "http://server/configuration.yaml" -a start
# HTTPS provider
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c "https://server/configuration.yaml" -a start
# S3 provider
sudo /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/bin/aws-otel-collector-ctl -c "s3://bucket-example.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/object.yaml" -a start
```

### Windows

On Windows you can use the `-ConfigLocation` command line parameter of the `aws-otel-collector-ctl.ps1` control script to setup the ADOT collector service.

Assuming you are in a Powershell session:
```
. C:\\Program Files\\Amazon\\AwsOtelCollector\\aws-otel-collector-ctl.ps1' -ConfigLocation "<uri>" -Action start
```

Here are some examples:

```
# File provider
. 'C:\Program Files\Amazon\AwsOtelCollector\aws-otel-collector-ctl.ps1' -ConfigLocation 'C:\path\to\file.yaml' -a start
# HTTP provider
. 'C:\Program Files\Amazon\AwsOtelCollector\aws-otel-collector-ctl.ps1' -ConfigLocation 'http://server/configuration.yaml' -a start
# HTTPS provider
. 'C:\Program Files\Amazon\AwsOtelCollector\aws-otel-collector-ctl.ps1' -ConfigLocation 'https://server/configuration.yaml' -a start
# S3 provider
. 'C:\Program Files\Amazon\AwsOtelCollector\aws-otel-collector-ctl.ps1' -ConfigLocation 's3://bucket-example.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/object.yaml' -a start
```

### Container environments

In container environments, you can override the Docker [CMD instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) to use the configuration from the URI that you want. This can be done
because all the parameters passed in the CMD instruction are passed to the ADOT collector since the [entrypoint for the ADOT collector image](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/cmd/awscollector/Dockerfile#L79) is the
Collector executable itself.


In ECS you can use the `command` property of the [environment container definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_environment) to specify the 
parameters that will be passed to the collector.

Example:

```json
    {
      "name": "aoc-collector",
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector:latest",
      "command": ["--config", "<configuration uri>"],
      "environment": [],
      "environmentFiles": [],
      "dependsOn": [],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "/ecs/ecs-cwagent-sidecar-collector",
          "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs",
          "awslogs-create-group": "True"
        }
      }
    }
```

Similarly, In Kubernetes you can use the `args` property of container definition to specify the command line parameters
that should be passed to the ADOT collector.

Example:
```yaml
# create namespace
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: aws-otel-eks
  labels:
    name: aws-otel-eks
---
# create deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aws-otel-eks-sidecar
  namespace: aws-otel-eks
  labels:
    name: aws-otel-eks-sidecar
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: aws-otel-eks-sidecar
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: aws-otel-eks-sidecar
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: aws-otel-collector
          image: "public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector:latest"
          env:
            - name: AWS_REGION
              value: "us-west-2"
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          args: ["--config", "<configuration uri>"]
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu:  256m
              memory: 512Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 32m
              memory: 24Mi
```

## Embedding URIs in the configuration

It is possible to embed configuration URIs in a configuration of the OpenTelemetry collector. These URIs will be expanded and replaced by the
content of the URI that they point to. To use this feature, you need to add the placeholders in the collector configuration with the
the following format: `${uri}`. You can provided URIs with any of the supported schemes.


The following pieces will demonstrate how this feature works. Supposed you have the following configuration that is passed to the
collector through the command line parameter.

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:

receivers:
${s3://example-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/receivers.yaml}

processors:
${s3://example-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/processors.yaml}

exporters:
${s3://example-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exporters.yaml}


service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp,awsxray]
      processors: [batch/traces]
      exporters: [awsxray]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch/metrics]
      exporters: [awsemf]

  extensions: [health_check]
```
In the example presented above, we are embeeding three different URIs. These embedded URIs will be expanded when the collector load the configuration.

The following is the content of each URI:

`s3://example-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/receivers.yaml`

```
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  awsxray:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:2000
    transport: udp
```

`s3://example-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/processors.yaml`

```
  batch/traces:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 50
  batch/metrics:
    timeout: 60s
```

`s3://example-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exporters.yaml`

```
  awsxray:
  awsemf:
```

The final configuration would look like:

```
extensions:
  health_check:

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  awsxray:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:2000
    transport: udp

processors:
  batch/traces:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 50
  batch/metrics:
    timeout: 60s

exporters:
  awsxray:
  awsemf:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp,awsxray]
      processors: [batch/traces]
      exporters: [awsxray]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch/metrics]
      exporters: [awsemf]

  extensions: [health_check]
  ```
