Lightstep supports OpenTelemetry natively, via OTLP. If youâ€™re already set up
with OpenTelemetry on AWS, then getting data into Lightstep only requires an
edit to the YAML config file for the Collector.

## Requirements

To connect to Lightstep, you will need the following:

* A lightstep account. If you don't already have one, you can create a free
  account [here](https://app.lightstep.com/signup/developer?signup_source=awsdoc).
* An access token for your Lightstep project. This can be found in project settings (the gear icon in the sidebar).

## Collector Configuration

* Configure the Collector to export **OTLP**.
* Set the OTLP endpoint to point to Lightstep.
  * **Public endpoint:** ingest.lightstep.com:443
  * **Private satellites:** the address of your satellite load balancer.
* Add your Lightstep access token as an OTLP header.
  * **Header name:** "lightstep-access-token"

## Example

```yaml
# Lightstep collector configuration
exporters:
  otlp:
     # NOTE: if you are using private satellites, replace this public
     # endpoint with the address of your satellite load balancer.
    endpoint: ingest.lightstep.com:443
     # Your access token can be found in the project settings page
    headers: {"lightstep-access-token":"<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"}
```
