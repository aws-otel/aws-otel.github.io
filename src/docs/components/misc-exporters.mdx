The logging exporter and file exporter are included as a part of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry(ADOT). An exporter is a component in the 
OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) configured to send data to different systems/back-ends. 
An exporter translates the 
[OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md) 
formatted data to a different predefined format to be interpreted by another system or back-end. Pipeline data includes logs, metrics, and traces. 
The logging exporter and file exporter are local exporters intended for debugging the Collector or OTLP formatted data without setting up a backend.

## Logging Exporter

The logging exporter writes OTLP data to the console using the [Zap Logger](https://github.com/uber-go/zap).  The file exporter currently 
supports logs, metrics, and traces. In order to start using the file exporter, you have to modify the yaml file configuration of the 
OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

The following settings are optional:

* `loglevel` (default = `info`): there are 4 type of settings debug, info, warn, and error. In debug, pipeline data is verbosely logged.
* `sampling_initial` (default = `2`): number of messages initially logged each second.
* `sampling_thereafter` (default = `500`): sampling rate after the initial messages are logged (every ith message is logged).

*Note: Refer to [Zap docs](https://godoc.org/go.uber.org/zap/zapcore#NewSampler) for more details on how sampling parameters impact number of messages.*

#### Example (Default):

```
exporters:
  logging:
```

#### Example (Configuring with optional settings) :

```
exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
    sampling_initial: 5
    sampling_thereafter: 200
```

## File Exporter

The file exporter writes pipeline data to a JSON file with [Protobuf JSON encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json) 
using [OpenTelemetry protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto).  The file exporter currently supports exporting logs, 
metrics, and traces. In order to start using the file exporter, you have to modify the yaml file configuration of the 
OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

Since there is no default path, you must declare the `path` location to a JSON file to write the pipeline data.

#### Example:

```
exporters:
  file:
    path: ./filename.json
```
