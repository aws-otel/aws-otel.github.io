title: 'Getting Started with X-Ray Receiver in AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector'
description:
    AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves, and provides tools you can
    use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization. For
    any traced request to your application, you can see detailed information not only about the request and response,
    but also about calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, microservices, databases and HTTP web APIs.

AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves, and provides tools you can use to
view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization. For any traced
request to your application, you can see detailed information not only about the request and response, but also about
calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, microservices, databases and HTTP web APIs.

AWS Container Observability team wrote a receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector.  This receiver takes place of the
original X-Ray-daemon, listens to a UDP port, gathers raw segment data, and relays it to AWS X-ray API through the
OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Overview

The AWS X-Ray receiver accepts segments (i.e. spans) in
the [X-Ray Segment format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html). This
enables the Collector to receive spans emitted by the existing X-Ray SDK.
[Centralized sampling](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-daemon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300-2018-08-28) is also
supported via a local TCP port.

The requests sent to AWS are authenticated using the mechanism documented
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials).

## Enable AWS X-Ray Receiver

To enable the awsxray receiver, write the name under receiver section in the OT config file `(local/config.yaml)` .
The default UDP address and port on which this receiver listens for X-Ray segment documents emitted by the X-Ray SDK
is `0.0.0.0:2000`. The `transport` can only be udp.

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  awsxray:
    transport: udp
exporters:
  awsxray:
    region: "us-west-2"
service:
  extensions:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [awsxray]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

## Set X-Ray Reciever Listening Endpoint

Customers can config the UDP address and port which the receiver listens for X-Ray segment documents emitted by the
X-ray SDK endpoint. Using `endpoint` under `awsxray` receiver. This example configuration will set UDP address
and port as 0.0.0.1:2001:

```yaml lineNumbers=true highlight={3}
receivers:
  awsxray:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.1:2001
    transport: udp
exporters:
  awsxray:
    region: "us-west-2"
service:
  extensions:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [awsxray]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

## Set X-Ray Reciever Configurations Related to the Local TCP Proxy Server

Customers can config the local TCP proxy server through `proxy_server`, under `awsxray`. By configuring `proxy_server`,
customers can tell `xrayreceiver` where it could get the sampling rules.
Go to [proxy server configuration](#proxy-server-configuration) to check the detailed explanation of every parameter
under `proxy_sever`. It will use default value if customer did set it.

```yaml lineNumbers=true highlight={5}
receivers:
  aws_xray:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.1:2001
    transport: udp
    proxy_server:
      endpoint: 0.0.0.0:2000
      proxy_address: ""
      insecure: false
      server_name_override: ""
      region: ""
      role_arn: ""
      aws_endpoint: ""
      local_mode: false
exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  awsxray:
    region: "us-west-2"
service:
  extensions:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [awsxray]
      exporters: [logging, awsxray]
```

## Proxy Server Configuration

You can add additional configuration in the above `proxy_server` section.

### endpoint (Optional)

The TCP address and port on which this receiver listens for calls from the X-Ray SDK and relays them to the
AWS X-Ray backend to get sampling rules and report sampling statistics.

Default: `0.0.0.0:2000`

### proxy_address (Optional)

Defines the proxy address that the local TCP server forwards HTTP requests to AWS X-Ray backend through. If
left unconfigured, requests will be sent directly.

### insecure (Optional)

Enables or disables TLS certificate verification when the local TCP server forwards HTTP requests to the AWS X-Ray backend.
This sets the `InsecureSkipVerify` in the [TLSConfig](https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config). When setting to true,
TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks so it should be used only for testing.

Default: `false`

### server_name_override (Optional)

This sets the `ServerName` in the [TLSConfig](https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config).

### region (Optional)

The AWS region the local TCP server forwards requests to. When missing, we will try to retrieve this
value through environment variables or optionally ECS/EC2 metadata endpoint (depends on `local_mode` below).

### role_arn (Optional)

The IAM role used by the local TCP server when communicating with the AWS X-Ray service. If non-empty, the receiver will
attempt to call STS to retrieve temporary credentials, otherwise the standard AWS credential
[lookup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials) will be performed.

### aws_endpoint (Optional)

The X-Ray service endpoint which the local TCP server forwards requests to.

### local_mode(Optional)

Determines whether the ECS/EC2 instance metadata endpoint will be called to fetch the AWS region to send requests to.
Set it to `true` to skip metadata check.

Default: `false`
