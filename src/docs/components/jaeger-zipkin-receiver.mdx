Jaeger receiver and Zipkin receiver are included as a part of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT).
A receiver is how data gets into the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector).
 Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the collector's internal format and passes it to
 processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. An exporter is a component in the
 OpenTelemetry configured to send data to different systems/backends.

## Jaeger Receiver

Jaeger receiver receives trace data in [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) format, translates it to OpenTelemetry traces format and
the collector pipeline can pass the data to different backends. You can find more information in OpenTelemetry Collector repository for
[Jaeger Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/jaegerreceiver/README.md)

#### Example:
By default, the Jaeger receiver will not serve any protocol. A protocol must be
named under the `protocols` object for the jaeger receiver to start. The
below protocols are supported, each supports an optional `endpoint`
object configuration parameter.

- `grpc` (default `endpoint` = 0.0.0.0:14250)
- `thrift_binary` (default `endpoint` = 0.0.0.0:6832)
- `thrift_compact` (default `endpoint` = 0.0.0.0:6831)
- `thrift_http` (default `endpoint` = 0.0.0.0:14268)

```yaml
receivers:
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      grpc:
  jaeger/withendpoint:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:14260
```

## Zipkin Receiver

Zipkin receiver receives spans in [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) (V1 and V2) format, translates it to OpenTelemetry traces format and
the collector pipeline can pass the date to different backends. You can find more information in OpenTelemetry Collector repository for
[Zipkin Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/zipkinreceiver/README.md).

#### Example:
All that is required to enable the Zipkin receiver is to include it in the
receiver definitions.

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
```
