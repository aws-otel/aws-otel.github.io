With the OpenTelemetry components, you can either instrument your application with the language APIs and their in-process 
exporters to send metrics data to a Prometheus backend or you can use the OpenTelemetry Collector with its out-of-process 
exporters to send metrics data to a Prometheus backend.

There are two types of Prometheus exporters available in OpenTelemetry - push based and pull based.

Read more [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/faq/#why-do-you-pull-rather-than-push) to learn when to use push vs.
pull for Prometheus.

## Push-based Prometheus Remote Write Exporter

A push-based Prometheus remote write exporter enables you to send metrics data generated from OpenTelemetry API, Prometheus 
instrumented libraries, or other sources, to a variety of Prometheus remote write integrated backends, including Cortex, Thanos, 
and InfluxDB. Users can visualize or configure alarms for the exported metrics to monitor the health of their services, improve 
performance, and detect anomalies.

to learn more about the Prometheus remote write exporter we implemented for the OpenTelemetry Collector. Here is another 
[blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/building-a-prometheus-remote-write-exporter-for-the-opentelemetry-go-sdk/) to 
learn more about the Prometheus remote write exporter we implemented for the OpenTelemetry Go SDK.

## Getting Started with AMP

Here is the [guide](/docs/getting-started/prometheus-remote-write-exporter) for using the AWS Managed Service for Prometheus 
(AMP) with the Prometheus Remote Write Collector available in AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

## Pull-based Prometheus Exporter

Prometheus is an open source system monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics data via a pull model over HTTP. The 
Prometheus server makes pull requests to the HTTP server exposed by the exporter and scrapes metrics data on a regular interval. 
Prometheus Exporter is used to maintain the HTTP server and to serve the metrics data collected by the OpenTelemetry Controller 
for Prometheus.
