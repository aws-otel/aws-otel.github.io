Welcome to the technical documentation for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

### About

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported
distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. Part of the Cloud Native Computing
Foundation, OpenTelemetry provides open source APIs, libraries, and agents to
collect distributed traces and metrics for application monitoring.

With AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your applications just once to send
correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions. Use auto-instrumentation agents to collect
traces without changing your code. AWS Distro
for OpenTelemetry also collects metadata from your AWS resources and
managed services, so you can correlate application performance data with
underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.

Use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to instrument your applications running on AWS Lambda,
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, and AWS Fargate, as well as on-
premises.

### Features
* **Instrument your applications** just once to send correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions and
use auto-instrumentation agents to collect traces without changing your code.
* **Collect metadata** from your AWS resources and managed services, so you can correlate application performance data
with underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.
* Use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to **observe your applications** running on AWS Lambda, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon
Elastic Container Service (ECS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, and AWS Fargate, as well as on-premises.
