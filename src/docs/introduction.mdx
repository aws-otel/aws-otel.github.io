Welcome to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) technical docs.Â 

### About

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported
distribution of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) 
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) project. OpenTelemetry (OTel)
provides open source APIs, libraries, and agents to collect distributed traces,
metrics, and logs for application monitoring.

With ADOT, you can instrument your applications once and send
correlated metrics and traces to one or more observability backends
such as Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray,
Amazon Open Search, any OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) compliant backend,
as well as Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK):

Further, you can use auto-instrumentation to generate traces without changing
your code. ADOT also collects metadata from your AWS resources and
managed services, so you can correlate application performance data with
underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.

Use ADOT to instrument your applications running on AWS App Runner, AWS Lambda,
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, and AWS Fargate, as well as 
in your datacenter, on-premises.

### Features

* **Instrument your applications** once to send correlated metrics and traces
to multiple monitoring solutions and use auto-instrumentation agents to collect 
traces without changing your code. Note that [logs support in ADOT is currently
in preview](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/ReleaseBlogs/aws-distro-for-opentelemetry-collector-v0.34.0).
* **Collect metadata** from your AWS resources and managed services, so you
can correlate application performance data with underlying infrastructure data,
reducing the mean time to problem resolution.
* Enables you to **observe your applications** running on AWS App Runner, 
AWS Lambda, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container 
Service (ECS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on EC2, and AWS
Fargate, as well as in hybrid cloud and on-prem settings.
