## Overview

[Lumigo](https://lumigo.io) provides an [ingestion endpoint for OTLP tracing data](https://docs.lumigo.io/docs/lumigo-opentelemetry-endpoint) sent over HTTP with protobuf or JSON encoding.

## Prerequisites

1. [Download the ADOT Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/releases).
2. [Deploy the ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).
3. Get your Lumigo token ready. And if you do not already have a Lumigo account, sign up for [Lumigo's free tier](https://lumigo.io/pricing/).

## Configuring the ADOT collector

Since Lumigo's tracing is built natively on top of the [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/), Lumigo has no dedicated exporter.
Rather, it uses the [upstream `otlphttp` exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter/README.md), using the `Authorization` HTTP header with the `LumigoToken` authentication scheme to provide the Lumigo token for authentication.

A minimal configuration to send trace data from the ADOT collector to Lumigo is as follows:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
exporters:
  otlphttp/lumigo:
    endpoint: https://ga-otlp.lumigo-tracer-edge.golumigo.com/v1/traces
    headers:
      Authorization: LumigoToken <token>

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      exporters: [otlphttp/lumigo]
```

In the snippet above, `<token>` must be replaced by your Lumigo token.

## Resources

The list of OpenTelemetry semantic conventions supported by Lumigo is available on [Lumigo's Supported Semantic Conventions documentation](https://docs.lumigo.io/docs/supported-semantic-conventions).
