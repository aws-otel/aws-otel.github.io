# Overview

:sparkles: **[New Relic offers OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) Ingest as a pre-release! To sign up, click here!](https://forms.gle/fa2pWcQxgVQYMggEA)** :sparkles:

This means you can configure the AWS OpenTelemetry Collector to use the OTLP exporter and no longer need this exporter to send data to New Relic.

New Relic's OpenTelemetry Collector Exporter sends `trace`, `metric`, and `log` data from the AWS OpenTelemetry Collector to New Relic. This capability gives you the power of instrumenting your entire stack for complete visibility and interoperability on the New Relic One platform. Use our curated out-of-the-box experiences and flexible visualization tools to quickly gain insight into how all your apps, systems and components are performing.


## Requirements

1. The New Relic OpenTelemetry Collector exporter is included in the AWS OTel Collector. It requires a functioning instance of the AWS OTel Collector to operate.
2. If you have not already done so, [create your New Relic account](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account).
3. Create an ingest API key using New Relicâ€™s [API Keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

## Configuration

The following configuration must be added to your existing AWS OTel Collector configuration yaml file.

1. Add the `newrelic` exporter to the list of configured exporters for traces, metrics, and logs in the `service` section:

  ```yaml
  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        exporters: [newrelic]
      metrics:
        exporters: [newrelic]
      logs:
        exporters: [newrelic]
  ```

2. Add the `newrelic` configuration to the `exporters` section with your New Relic Ingest API Key:

  ```yaml
  exporters:
    newrelic:
      apikey: your_ingest_api_key_goes_here
  ```

## New Relic Exporter Configuration Options

#### apikey (Required)

Your New Relic Insights Insert API Key or License Key.

#### timeout (Optional)

Amount of time spent attempting a request before abandoning and dropping data.

Default is 15 seconds.

#### Example EU configuration

```yaml
exporters:
  newrelic:
    apikey: super-secret-api-key
    timeout: 30s

    # host_override is set to send data to New Relic's EU data centers.
    traces:
      host_override: trace-api.eu.newrelic.com
    metrics:
      host_override: metric-api.eu.newrelic.com
    logs:
      host_override: log-api.eu.newrelic.com
```


## Complete example configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  newrelic:
    apikey: your_ingest_api_key_goes_here
    timeout: 30s

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
