# Overview

✨ **[New Relic offers OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) Ingest! No exporter is required. To sign up, click here!](https://forms.gle/fa2pWcQxgVQYMggEA)** ✨


New Relic's platform can receive `trace`, `metric`, and `log` data from the AWS OpenTelemetry Collector via OTLP. This capability gives you the power of instrumenting your entire stack for complete visibility and interoperability on the New Relic One platform. Use our curated out-of-the-box experiences and flexible visualization tools to quickly gain insight into how all your apps, systems and components are performing.


## Requirements

1. The New Relic OpenTelemetry Collector exporter is included in the AWS OTel Collector. It requires a functioning instance of the AWS OTel Collector to operate.
2. If you have not already done so, [create your New Relic account](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account).
3. Create an ingest license key using New Relic’s [API Keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

## Configuration

Here's an example OpenTelemetry Collector configuration (OTLP Input OpenTelemetry Collector YAML):

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
