## Overview

Datadog provides monitoring and insights into infrastructure and application performance across your entire stack. The AWS Distro for Open Telemetry includes the [Datadog exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/datadogexporter), which takes OpenTelemetry data (metrics and traces) collected by the AWS OTel Collector and forwards it on to Datadog. From there, you can use Datadog tools and dashboards to analyze and solve performance problems in your distributed apps.

## Prerequisites

1. [Download the AWS OTel Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/releases).
2. [Deploy the AWS OTel Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).
3. [Get a copy of your Datadog API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/). If you don't already have a Datadog account, sign up for a [Datadog Free Trial](https://www.datadoghq.com/free-datadog-trial/).

## Configuring the exporter

Configure the AWS OTel collector to send metrics and traces to Datadog by adding a `datadog` exporter to your [OpenTelemetry configuration YAML file](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) along with your Datadog API key:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
datadog:
  api:
    key: "<API key>"
```
To send the data to the Datadog EU site, also set the `site` parameter:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
datadog:
  api:
    key: "<API key>"
    site: datadoghq.eu
```

**For trace data:** Include a batch processor configured with a required `timeout` setting of `10s` (10 seconds). This sends batches of trace data to Datadog every 10 seconds, ensuring efficient and accurate trace metrics processing.

```yaml lineNumbers=true
processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
```

## Specifying resource attributes

On each OpenTelemetry-instrumented application, set the resource attributes `development.environment`, `service.name`, and `service.version` using [the language's SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/). As a fall-back, you can also configure hostname (optionally), environment, service name, and service version at the collector level for [unified service tagging](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging) by following the [example configuration file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/master/exporter/datadogexporter/example/config.yaml). If you don't specify the hostname explicitly, the exporter attempts to get an automatic default by checking the following sources in order, falling back to the next one if the current one is unavailable or invalid:

<!--- 1. Hostname set by another OpenTelemetry component -->
1. Manually set the hostname in configuration
1. EC2 non-default hostname (if in an EC2 instance)
1. EC2 instance id (if in an EC2 instance)
1. Fully qualified domain name
1. Operating system hostname

## Configuring the pipeline

Finally, add a `datadog` exporter pipeline to your `otel-collector-configuration.yml` file. This shows a `traces` pipeline:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog/api]
```

## Example configurations

Here is an example configuration for collecting trace data using the `otlp` receiver, a batch processor, the `datadog` exporter with resource attributes and tags, and a trace pipeline configured with an `otlp` receiver, `batch` processor, and `datadog` exporter:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  otlp:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  datadog/api:
    hostname: i-0e123a456a123456a
    env: prod
    service: web-store
    version: 7.1.0

    tags:
      - geo.country:fr

    api:
      key: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
      site: datadoghq.eu

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog/api]
```

Here is an example configuration for collecting metrics data:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  otlp:

exporters:
  datadog/api:
    hostname: i-0e123a456a123456a
    env: prod

    tags:
      - geo.country:fr

    api:
      key: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
      site: datadoghq.eu

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [datadog/api]
```

Supply the relative path to this configuration file when you start the collector by passing it in using the `--config=<path/to/configuration_file>` command line argument. For examples of supplying a configuration file, see the [AWS OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) for your target platform.
