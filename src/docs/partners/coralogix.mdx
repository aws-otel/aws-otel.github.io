## Overview

Coralogix provides monitoring and insights into infrastructure and application performance across your entire stack. The AWS Distro for Open Telemetry includes the [Coralogix exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/coralogixexporter), which takes OpenTelemetry data (metrics, traces and logs) collected by the ADOT Collector and forwards it on to Coralogix. From there, you can use Coralogix tools and dashboards to analyze and solve performance problems in your distributed apps.

## Prerequisites

1. [Download the ADOT Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/releases).
2. [Deploy the ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).
3. [Get a copy of your Coralogix Private key and endpoints](https://coralogix.com/docs/guide-first-steps-coralogix/). If you don't have a Coralogix account, sign up for a [Coralogix Free Account](https://signup.coralogix.com/).

## Configuring the exporter

Configure the ADOT collector to send metrics, traces and logs to Coralogix by adding a `coralogix` exporter to your [OpenTelemetry configuration YAML file](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) along with your Coralogix Private key and your endpoint:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
exporters:
  coralogix:
    # The Coralogix traces ingress endpoint
    traces:
      endpoint: "<coralogix-traces-endpoint>"
    metrics:
      endpoint: "<coralogix-metrics-endpoint>"
    logs:
      endpoint: "<coralogix-logs-endpoint>"

    # Your Coralogix private key is sensitive
    private_key: "xxx"

    # Data emitted by this OpenTelemetry exporter should be tagged
    # in Coralogix with the following application and subsystem names
    application_name: "MyBusinessEnvironment"
    subsystem_name: "MyBusinessSystem"

```

## Configuring the pipeline

Finally, add a `coralogix` exporter pipeline to your `otel-collector-configuration.yml` file. This shows a `traces` pipeline:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [coralogix]
```

## Example configurations

Here is an example configuration for collecting trace data using the `otlp` receiver, a batch processor, the `coralogix` exporter with resource attributes and tags, and a trace pipeline configured with an `otlp` receiver, `batch` processor, and `coralogix` exporter:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  otlp:

processors:
  batch: {}

exporters:
  coralogix:
    # The Coralogix traces ingress endpoint
    endpoint: "<coralogix-traces-endpoint>"
    # Your Coralogix private key is sensitive
    private_key: "xxx"

    # Data emitted by this OpenTelemetry exporter should be tagged
    # in Coralogix with the following application and subsystem names
    application_name: "MyBusinessEnvironment"
    subsystem_name: "MyBusinessSystem"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [coralogix]
```

Here is an example configuration for collecting metrics data:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  otlp:

exporters:
  coralogix:
    # The Coralogix metrics endpoint
    metrics:
      endpoint: "<coralogix-metric-endpoint>"
    # Your Coralogix private key is sensitive
    private_key: "xxx"

    # Data emitted by this OpenTelemetry exporter should be tagged
    # in Coralogix with the following application and subsystem names
    application_name: "MyBusinessEnvironment"
    subsystem_name: "MyBusinessSystem"


  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [coralogix]
```

Here is an example configuration for collecting logs data:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  otlp:

exporters:
  coralogix:
    # The Coralogix logs endpoint
    logs:
      endpoint: "<coralogix-logs-endpoint>"
    # Your Coralogix private key is sensitive
    private_key: "xxx"

    # Data emitted by this OpenTelemetry exporter should be tagged
    # in Coralogix with the following application and subsystem names
    application_name: "MyBusinessEnvironment"
    subsystem_name: "MyBusinessSystem"


  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [coralogix]
```

Supply the relative path to this configuration file when you start the collector by passing it in using the `--config=<path/to/configuration_file>` command line argument. For examples of supplying a configuration file, see the [AWS OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) for your target platform.
