## Use the CloudWatch Application Signals Console

Use these steps to enable AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) auto-instrumentation through the CloudWatch console:

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Application Signals**, **Services**
3. In the **Services** list area, choose **Enable Application Signals**
4. Choose the **Lambda** tile
5. Select each function that you want to enable for Application Signals, and then choose **Done**

<SectionSeparator />

## Use the AWS CDK

### 1. Add the IAM policy.

```typescript
const fn = new Function(this, 'DemoFunction', {
    code: Code.fromAsset('$YOUR_LAMBDA.zip'),
    runtime: Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
    handler: '$YOUR_HANDLER'
})

fn.role?.addManagedPolicy(ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName(
    'CloudWatchLambdaApplicationSignalsExecutionRolePolicy'));
```

### 2. Add AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Layer

```typescript
fn.addLayers(LayerVersion.fromLayerVersionArn(
    this, 'AwsLambdaLayerForOtel',
    '$AWS_LAMBDA_LAYER_FOR_OTEL_ARN'
))
fn.addEnvironment("AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER", "/opt/otel-instrument");
// [Optional] Disable AWS Application Signals
// Recommended to keep the AWS Application Signals turned on for the complete APM experience
// fn.addEnvironment("OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED", "false");
```

Replace `$AWS_LAMBDA_LAYER_FOR_OTEL_ARN` with the actual [AWS Lambda Layer for OpenTelemetry ARN in the corresponding region and language](#adot-lambda-layer-arns).

### (Optional) Enable Application Signals Discovery

<InfoBox
  textContent="Note: This configuration only needs to be performed once per account and region"
/>

If you enabled Application Signals (recommended), grant the required permissions to discover your RUM, Synthetics or uninstrumented services. For more information, see [Enable Application Signals in your account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable.html)

```typescript
import { aws_applicationsignals as applicationsignals } from 'aws-cdk-lib';

const cfnDiscovery = new applicationsignals.CfnDiscovery(this,
  'ApplicationSignalsServiceRole', { } );
```

## Manually Add AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Lambda Layers

1. **Add the ADOT Lambda Layer** to your Lambda runtime. Find the layer ARN for your region in the [Lambda Layer ARNs section](#adot-lambda-layer-arns) below.

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument`
   - (optional) `LAMBDA_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_REMOTE_ENVIRONMENT` - Configure custom Lambda environments. Default is `lambda:default`
   - (optional) `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=false` - To disable AWS Application Signals.

3. **Attach IAM Policy** - Add the AWS managed IAM policy `CloudWatchLambdaApplicationSignalsExecutionRolePolicy` to the Lambda execution role.

4. **Enable Active Tracing** (Optional but recommended) - Enable Lambda active tracing to get a better tracing experience.

<SectionSeparator />

## Manually Remove AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Lambda Layer

1. **Remove the ADOT Lambda Layer** from your Lambda runtime.
2. Remove the `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument` environment variable.

## Configuration Options

### Sampling Configuration

By default, the trace sampling strategy is parent-based. You can adjust sampling by setting `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER`:

For example, in order to set trace sampling rate to 30%.

```
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=traceidratio
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.3
```

For more information , see [OpenTelemetry Environment Variable Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/).

### Enable All Library Instrumentations

To reduce Lambda cold starts, by default only AWS SDK and HTTP instrumentations are enabled. Enable all instrumentations with:

- **Python:** `OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=none`
- **Node.js:** `OTEL_NODE_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=none`
- **Java:** `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_COMMON_DEFAULT_ENABLED=true`

### Service Grouping

Set the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable to group multiple Lambda functions into one service. This name will be displayed in Application Signals dashboards. Functions with the same service name will be merged into a single service.

### Traces Exporter

By default, traces are exported in OTLP format through the Lambda embedded agent to CloudWatch X-Ray.
No additional configuration is required, and this setup provides the best performance.

If you need to export traces to a custom OTLP endpoint, configure the OTLP exporter settings as described in the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/#otel_exporter_otlp_traces_endpoint).

### Metrics Exporter

By default, metrics exporting is disabled.

To send metrics to CloudWatch, ADOT Lambda provides two options:

**Option 1. Send EMF to the Lambda Application Log Group **

Enable metrics export using EMF (Embedded Metric Format) by setting:

```
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=awsemf
```

With this setting:

- EMF logs are published to the default Lambda application log group
- This mode provides the best performance

**Option 2. Send EMF to a Custom Log Group**

To publish EMF logs to a custom CloudWatch Log Group and Log Stream, set:

```
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=awsemf
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_HEADERS=x-aws-log-group=<LOG_GROUP>,x-aws-log-stream=<LOG_STREAM>
```

Note:
`x-aws-log-group` and `x-aws-log-stream` must be specified together. Additionally, the Lambda execution role must have `CreateLogGroup`, `CreateLogStream`, and `PutLogEvents` permissions for the target log resource.

**(Optional) Customize the Metrics Namespace**

By default, metrics are published to CloudWatch using the namespace **default**. To customize the CloudWatch metrics namespace for your Lambda function, include:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_HEADERS=x-aws-metric-namespace=<NAMESPACE>
```

### Logs Exporter

By default, logs exporting is disabled.

To send OpenTelemetry logs to CloudWatch, ADOT Lambda provides two options:

**Option 1. Export Logs to the Lambda Application Log Group**

To export logs via the Lambda embedded agent to the default log group, set:

```
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=console
```

**Option 2. Export Logs to a Custom Log Group**

To export logs to a custom CloudWatch Log Group and Log Stream, configure:

```
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_HEADERS=x-aws-log-group=<LOG_GROUP>,x-aws-log-stream=<LOG_STREAM>
```

**Logging Library Configuration**

If you do not see any OpenTelemetry logs, ensure that the logging library instrumentation is enabled and configured correctly:

- **Python**
  ```
  OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true
  ```

- **Node.js**

  Take the example of using winston:
  1. Enable winston instrumentation (and other desired instrumentations) by setting:

  ```
  OTEL_NODE_ENABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS="aws-sdk,aws-lambda,http,winston"
  ```
  2. Configure winston to use OpenTelemetry transport:
  ```
  const winston = require('winston');
  const { OpenTelemetryTransportV3 } = require('@opentelemetry/winston-transport');

  const logger = winston.createLogger({
    level: 'info',
    transports: [
      new OpenTelemetryTransportV3()
    ]
  });

  ```

<SectionSeparator />

## Container Image Deployment

Lambda functions deployed as container images do not support Lambda Layers in the traditional way. When using container images, you cannot attach a layer as you would with other Lambda deployment methods. Instead, you must manually incorporate the layer’s contents into your container image during the build process.

For detailed container integration examples for Java, Node.js, Python, and .NET, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable-LambdaMain.html#containerized-lambda).

<SectionSeparator />

## Monitor Application Health

**[Recommended]** Once you have enabled Application Signals on your Lambda functions, you can monitor your application health through the CloudWatch Application Signals console. This provides:

- **Service Maps** - Visual representation of your application architecture
- **Traces** - Detailed request flow and performance metrics
- **Metrics** - Standard application metrics and custom metrics
- **Alarms** - Automated alerts based on performance thresholds

For more information, see [Monitor the operational health of your applications with Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Services.html).
