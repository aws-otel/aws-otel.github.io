## Introduction
Welcome to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Go getting started guide. This walk-through covers the ADOT Go components, how to
configure the ADOT components to capture traces with OpenTelemetry Go and AWS X-Ray, as well as how to use the AWS Elastic Container Service
(AWS ECS) and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS) resource detectors. Before reading this guide, you should familiarize with
distributed tracing and the basics of OpenTelemetry. To learn more about getting started with OpenTelemetry Go, see the
[OpenTelemetry developer documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/go/).

## Requirements
Go `v1.15` or later is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry. [Here's](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go#compatibility) the compatibility chart of OpenTelemetry Go SDK with different `OS`, `Go Version` and `Architecture`.

Note: You’ll also need to have the [ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Installation
Download and install the following packages to use ADOT Components with OpenTelemetry Go SDK for tracing.

```
1. X-Ray ID Generator
2. X-Ray propagator
3. OTel Go SDK for tracing
4. OTel Go API for tracing
5. OTLP gRPC exporter for exporting trace data

## Setting up the Global Tracer

### Sending Traces to AWS X-Ray

This section talks about how to instantiate a new tracer provider with the X-Ray ID generator and sampling config, setting global options (X-Ray propagator, tracer provider) and instantiate OTLP exporter with the collector's address to export trace data.

#### Creating an OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) Exporter

<img src={goImg2} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

OpenTelemetry Go requires an exporter to send traces to a backend. Exporters allow telemetry data to be transferred either to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector), or to a remote system or console for further analysis.The ADOT Collector is a separate process that is designed to be a `sink` for telemetry data emitted by many processes, which can then export
that data to various back-end systems.

To initialize the OTLP exporter, add the following code to the file the `main.go` file.
```go lineNumbers=true
// Create and start new OTLP trace exporter
traceExporter, err := otlptracegrpc.New(ctx, otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure(), otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint("0.0.0.0:4317"), otlptracegrpc.WithDialOption(grpc.WithBlock()))
if err != nil {
     log.Fatalf("%s: %v", "failed to create new OTLP trace exporter", err)
}
```

This creates a new OTLP exporter with a few options - `WithInsecure()` disables client transport security for the exporter's gRPC connection, `WithEndpoint()` allows you to set the address that the exporter will connect to the Collector on. If the address is unset, it will instead try to use connect to `DefaultCollectorHost:DefaultCollectorPort`. If the Collector you are connecting uses TLS, for example in a [sidecar deployment](/docs/getting-started/collector/sidecar-vs-service),
pass `otlptracegrpc.WithTLSCredentials` instead of `otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()`.

#### Creating a Tracer Provider

In order to generate traces, OpenTelemetry Go SDK requires a trace provider to be created. A Trace provider can have multiple different span processors, which are components that give the ability to modify and export span data after it has been created.

To create a new trace provider, add the following lines to the `main.go` file.
```go lineNumbers=true
idg := xray.NewIDGenerator()

tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(
	trace.WithSampler(trace.AlwaysSample()),
	trace.WithBatcher(traceExporter)
	trace.WithIDGenerator(idg),
)
```

Above block of code creates a new `TracerProvider` with a Sampler that samples every trace, and an ID Generator that will generate trace IDs that conform to AWS X-Ray’s format, as well as register the OLTP exporter we created in the previous section.

#### Setting Global Options

Setting a global tracer provider is considered good practice when working with OpenTelemetry Go SDK because it will make easier for other libraries/dependencies that use the OpenTelemetry API to easily discover the SDK and emit telemetry data. In addition to setting a global tracer provider, we will also configure the context propagation option. Context propagation refers to sharing data across
multiple processes or services. This ability to correlate information across service boundaries is one of the principal concepts behind distributed tracing. To find these correlations, components in a distributed system need to be able to collect, store, and transfer metadata referred to as context. Propagator structs are configured inside Tracer structs in order to support transferring of context across process boundaries. A context will often have information
identifying the current span and trace, and can contain arbitrary correlations as key-value pairs. Propagation is when context is bundled and transferred across services, often via HTTP headers.

To set up global options, we will use the `otel` package and add the following lines to the `main.go` file.
```go lineNumbers=true
    otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
    otel.SetTextMapPropagator(xray.Propagator{})
```

### Using the AWS resource Detectors

OpenTelemetry Go SDK has AWS ECS and EKS resource detector support. The resource detectors are responsible for detecting whether Go application instrumented with OpenTelemetry is running on the respective environment (like ECS or EKS) or not. If the resource detector does in fact detect that it is running on environments like ECS or EKS, it will populate the `resource` with environment (ECS or EKS) metadata. The metadata will include the `containerId` and `hostName` for ECS and `containerId` and `clusterName` for EKS which will be formatted as key value pairs inside the `resource` struct. If the resource detector detects that the application
is not running on an environment (ECS or EKS), then it will return an empty `resource` struct.

<img src={goImg5} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the ECS resource detector.
```go lineNumbers=true
// Instantiate a new ECS Resource detector
ecsResourceDetector := ecs.NewResourceDetector()
resource, err := ecsResourceDetector.Detect(context.Background())

//Associate resource with TracerProvider
tracerProvider := trace.NewTracerProvider(
   trace.WithResource(resource),
)
```

## Instrumenting an Application

[Here's](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation) a list of instrumentation packages that OpenTelemetry Go SDK supports to trace various calls (incoming request, outgoing HTTP calls and SQL calls). Check out the `example` directory inside each instrumentation package for instrumentation instructions.

### Instrumenting the AWS SDK

Below example displays AWS SDK v2 instrumentation. Check out this [link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/987c197ab0ca775f06a157f2db689fb9af9337d7/instrumentation/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/otelaws/example) for complete AWS SDK v2 instrumentation example.
```go lineNumbers=true
var trace = otel.Tracer("demo")
ctx, span := tracer.Start(context.Background(), "AWS SDK instrumentation")
defer span.End()

// init aws config
cfg, err := awsConfig.LoadDefaultConfig(ctx)
if err != nil {
		panic("configuration error, " + err.Error())
}

// instrument all aws clients
otelaws.AppendMiddlewares(&cfg.APIOptions)

// Call to S3
s3Client := s3.NewFromConfig(cfg)
	input := &s3.ListBucketsInput{}
	result, err := s3Client.ListBuckets(ctx, input)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Got an error retrieving buckets, %v", err)
		return
	}
```

## Custom Instrumentation

### Creating Custom Spans

You can use custom spans to monitor the performance of internal activities that are not captured by instrumentation libraries. Note that only spans of kind `Server` are converted into X-Ray segments, all other spans are converted into X-Ray subsegments. For more on segments and subsegments, see the [AWS X-Ray developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-segments).

Below example shows how to create custom spans.
```go lineNumbers=true
var tracer = otel.Tracer("demo")
	ctx, span := tracer.Start(context.Background(), "span")
	_, span2 := tracer.Start(ctx, "subspan")
	defer span2.End()
	defer span.End()
```

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Adding custom attributes

You can also add custom key-value pairs as attributes onto your spans. If you add special prefixes to these attributes, they will be automatically converted to metadata or annotations in the X-Ray backend. To read more about X-Ray annotations and metadata see the [AWS X-Ray Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-segments).

Below example displays how to add attributes to the span.
```go lineNumbers=true
var tracer = otel.Tracer("demo")
_, span := tracer.Start(
			context.Background(),
			"DemoExample",
			trace.WithAttributes(attribute.String("a", "1")))
defer span.End()
```
