## Introduction
Welcome to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Go getting started guide. This walk-through covers the ADOT Go components, how to
configure the ADOT components to capture traces with OpenTelemetry Go and AWS X-Ray, as well as how to use the AWS Elastic Container Service
(AWS ECS) and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS) resource detectors. Before reading this guide, you should familiarize with
distributed tracing and the basics of OpenTelemetry. To learn more about getting started with OpenTelemetry Go, see the
[OpenTelemetry developer documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/go/).

## Requirements
Go `v1.15` or later is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry. Visit the [compatibility chart](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go#compatibility) of OpenTelemetry Go SDK with different `OS`, `Go Version` and `Architecture`.

Note: You’ll also need to have the [ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

<SectionSeparator />

## Installation
Download and install the following packages to use ADOT Components with OpenTelemetry Go SDK for tracing.

```
1. X-Ray ID Generator
2. X-Ray propagator
3. OTel Go SDK for tracing
4. OTel Go API for tracing
5. OTLP gRPC exporter for exporting trace data
```

To install the above mentioned necessary prerequisites, run the following command in the same directory that the application `go.mod` file is in:
```
go get go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/propagators/aws/xray
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace
```

## Setting up the Global Tracer

### Sending Traces to AWS X-Ray

This section talks about how to instantiate a new tracer provider with the X-Ray ID generator and sampling config, setting global options (X-Ray propagator, tracer provider) and instantiate OTLP exporter with the collector's address to export trace data.

#### Creating an OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) Exporter

<img src={goImg2} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

OpenTelemetry Go requires an exporter to send traces to a backend. Exporters allow telemetry data to be transferred either to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector), or to a remote system or console for further analysis. The ADOT Collector is a separate process that is designed to be a "sink" for telemetry data emitted by many processes, which can then export
that data to various back-end systems.

To initialize the OTLP exporter, add the following code to the file the `main.go` file.
```go lineNumbers=true
// Create and start new OTLP trace exporter
traceExporter, err := otlptracegrpc.New(ctx, otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure(), otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint("0.0.0.0:4317"), otlptracegrpc.WithDialOption(grpc.WithBlock()))
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("failed to create new OTLP trace exporter: %v", err)
}
```

This creates a new OTLP exporter with a few options - `WithInsecure()` disables client transport security for the exporter's gRPC connection, `WithEndpoint()` allows you to set the address that the exporter will connect to the Collector on. If the address is unset, it will instead try to use connect to `localhost:4317`. If the Collector you are connecting uses TLS, for example in a [service deployment](/docs/getting-started/collector/sidecar-vs-service),
pass `otlptracegrpc.WithTLSCredentials()` instead of `otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()`.

#### Creating a Tracer Provider

In order to generate traces, OpenTelemetry Go SDK requires a tracer provider to be created. A tracer provider can have multiple different span processors, which are components that give the ability to modify and export span data after it has been created.

To create a new tracer provider, add the following lines to the `main.go` file.
```go lineNumbers=true
idg := xray.NewIDGenerator()

tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(
	trace.WithSampler(trace.AlwaysSample()),
	trace.WithBatcher(traceExporter),
	trace.WithIDGenerator(idg),
)
```

Above block of code creates a new `TracerProvider` with a Sampler that samples every trace, and an ID Generator that will generate trace IDs that conform to AWS X-Ray’s format, as well as register the OLTP exporter we created in the previous section.

#### Setting Global Options

In addition to setting a global tracer provider, we will also configure the context propagation option. Context propagation refers to sharing data across multiple processes or services. Propagator structs are configured inside Tracer structs to support context propagation across process boundaries. A context will often have information
identifying the current span and trace, and can contain arbitrary information as key-value pairs.

To set up global options, we will use the `otel` package and add the following lines to the `main.go` file.
```go lineNumbers=true
otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
otel.SetTextMapPropagator(xray.Propagator{})
```

### Using the AWS resource Detectors

OpenTelemetry Go SDK has AWS EC2, ECS and EKS resource detector support. The resource detectors are responsible for detecting whether a Go application instrumented with OpenTelemetry is running on the respective environment, and populating resource attributes for that environment if available. If the resource detector detects that the application
is not running on an environment (EC2, ECS or EKS), then it will return an empty `resource` struct.

<img src={goImg5} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

Run `go get go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/detectors/aws/ec2` command to import the EC2 resource detector module. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the EC2 resource detector. Visit OpenTelemetry AWS Resource Detectors [README](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/detectors/aws/README.md) to get more information on which environment attributes are being captured by resource detectors.
```go lineNumbers=true
// Instantiate a new EC2 Resource detector
ec2ResourceDetector := ec2.NewResourceDetector()
resource, err := ec2ResourceDetector.Detect(context.Background())

// Associate resource with TracerProvider
tracerProvider := trace.NewTracerProvider(
	trace.WithResource(resource),
)
```

## Instrumenting an Application

Visit the [OpenTelemetry Go SDK repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation) for a list of instrumentation packages that OpenTelemetry Go SDK supports to trace various calls (incoming requests, outgoing HTTP calls and SQL calls). Check out the `example` directory inside each instrumentation package for instrumentation instructions.

### Instrumenting the AWS SDK

Run `go get go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/otelaws` command to import the AWS SDK v2 instrumentation module. The below example displays AWS SDK v2 instrumentation. Check out the complete AWS SDK v2 instrumentation [example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/987c197ab0ca775f06a157f2db689fb9af9337d7/instrumentation/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/otelaws/example).
Note: We currently don't provide support for instrumenting AWS SDK v1 calls.
```go lineNumbers=true
tracer := otel.Tracer("demo")
ctx, span := tracer.Start(context.Background(), "AWS SDK instrumentation")
defer span.End()

// init aws config
cfg, err := awsConfig.LoadDefaultConfig(ctx)
if err != nil {
	panic("configuration error, " + err.Error())
}

// instrument all aws clients
otelaws.AppendMiddlewares(&cfg.APIOptions)

// Call to S3
s3Client := s3.NewFromConfig(cfg)
input := &s3.ListBucketsInput{}
result, err := s3Client.ListBuckets(ctx, input)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Got an error retrieving buckets, %v", err)
	return
}
```

## Configuring Sampling

By default, the OpenTelemetry Go SDK samples 100% of incoming requests by using [`AlwaysSample`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace#AlwaysSample).

### Reduce Sampling Rate

To reduce the sampling rate, configure OpenTelemetry Go SDK to use [`TraceIDRatioBased`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace#TraceIDRatioBased) sampler. Below is the code
snippet to configure the `TraceIDRatioBased` sampler to sample 10% of requests.

```go lineNumbers=true
 // initialize the traceIDRatioBasedSampler
 traceIDRatioBasedSampler := trace.TraceIDRatioBased(0.10)

 // attach traceIDRatioBasedSampler to tracer provider
 tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(trace.WithSampler(traceIDRatioBasedSampler))
```

### Sampling using AWS X-Ray Remote Sampler

AWS X-Ray remote sampler can be initialized using `NewRemoteSampler` API. `NewRemoteSampler` can be configured with below options. If AWS X-Ray remote sampler is not able to fetch sampling rules or targets from AWS X-Ray  due to networking or config issues(collector) then remote sampler uses fallback sampler. Fallback sampler always samples 1 req/sec and 5% of additional requests during that second. Moreover, remote sampler uses `TraceIDRatioBased` sampler to enforce [`Rate`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html#xray-console-config) set by customers on AWS X-Ray Console after
[`Reservoir`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html#xray-console-config) quota is consumed.

NOTE: ctx passed in `NewRemoteSampler` API is being used in background go routine which serves `getSamplingRules` and `getSamplingTargets` API call. So any cancellation in context would also kill the go routine. Ideally, passed context should not be scoped to any kind of startup processes where context is short lived.

| **NewRemoteSampler API options**                                  | **Description**                                                      | **Default Configuration**                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `WithEndpoint(endpoint url.URL)`                                  | Endpoint used to communicate with the `awsproxy` collector extension | http://localhost:2000                              |
| `WithSamplingRulesPollingInterval(interval time.Duration)`        | Duration between polling of the GetSamplingRules API                 | 300 seconds                                        |
| `WithLogger(l logr.Logger)`                                       | logging for remote sampler                                           | [go-logr/stdr](https://github.com/go-logr/stdr)    |

```go lineNumbers=true
   ctx := context.Background()

   endpoint, err := url.Parse("http://127.0.0.1:2000"); if err != nil {
         return
   }

   // instantiate remote sampler with options
   rs, err := NewRemoteSampler(ctx, "service_name", "cloud_platform", WithEndpoint(endpoint), WithSamplingRulesPollingInterval(350 * time.Second)); if err != nil {
         return
   }

   // attach remote sampler to tracer provider
   tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(trace.WithSampler(rs))
```

## Custom Instrumentation

### Creating Custom Spans

You can use custom spans to monitor the performance of internal activities that are not captured by instrumentation libraries. Note that only spans of kind `Server` are converted into X-Ray segments, all other spans are converted into X-Ray subsegments. For more on segments and subsegments, see the [AWS X-Ray developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-segments).

The below example shows how to create custom spans.
```go lineNumbers=true
tracer := otel.Tracer("demo")

// this span will be translated to a segment in X-Ray backend
ctx, span := tracer.Start(context.Background(), "segment", trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindServer))

// this span will be translated to a subsegment in X-Ray backend
_, span2 := tracer.Start(ctx, "subsegment", trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindClient))

defer span2.End()
defer span.End()
```

### Adding custom attributes

You can also add custom key-value pairs as attributes onto your spans. The below example displays how to add attributes to the span. You can convert some or all attributes to annotations via the [collector config](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/7bf2266a025425993a233f66c77a0810ab11a78b/exporter/awsxrayexporter#aws-specific-attributes), and otherwise they are metadata by default. To read more about X-Ray annotations and metadata see the [AWS X-Ray Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-annotations).
```go lineNumbers=true
var tracer = otel.Tracer("demo")
_, span := tracer.Start(
	context.Background(),
	"DemoExample",
	trace.WithAttributes(attribute.String("a", "1")))
defer span.End()
```
