    'The OpenTelemetry Collector has three key components: the receiver, exporter, and processor. The receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector is responsible 
    for receiving data via gRPC or HTTP using the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP). The AWS X-Ray exporter available in the OpenTelemetry Collector converts 
    OTLP formatted trace data to the AWS X-Ray format and then exports this data to the AWS X-Ray service. The processor component pre-processes data 
    before it is exported, for example it is able to modify attributes, limit memory usage, or enable retries.'

The OpenTelemetry Collector has three key components: the receiver, exporter, and processor. The receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector 
is responsible for receiving data via gRPC or HTTP using the 
[OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md). 
The AWS X-Ray exporter available in the OpenTelemetry Collector converts OTLP formatted trace data to the AWS X-Ray format and then exports 
this data to the AWS X-Ray service.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to configure the AWS Distro for the OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Collector for use with AWS X-Ray.
To learn more about AWS X-Ray, see the [X-Ray Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html).

## Prerequisites

To get started using the ADOT Collector to connect with AWS X-Ray to analyze distributed traces, you have to first install AWS 
Distro for the OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector). Make sure you have your access key ID 
and secret access key properly configured in the docker file. You can generate access key ID and secret access key with the information 
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html).

In order to set up the ADOT Collector on a particular platform such as EKS, ECS, EC2 or on-premises, please see the Getting Started guide for

* [ECS](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/ecs)
* [EC2](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/ec2)
* [EKS](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/eks)
* [On-Premises](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/on-premises)

ADOT also includes fully managed AWS Lambda Layers, which include an OpenTelemetry SDK and the ADOT Collector to auto-instrument your function for tracing with X-Ray.
See [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda](/docs/getting-started/lambda) to get started.

## Configuring the OTLP Receiver

To enable the OTLP receiver, we include the “otlp” flag in the definitions. You will have to set the “endpoint” consisting of `<host>:<port>` for 
the gRPC or HTTP protocols. You can change the endpoints depending on how you set up your instrumentation with OpenTelemetry.

#### Example:

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
```

*Note: A protocol can be disabled by not specifying it in the list of protocols.*

## Configuring the AWS X-Ray Exporter

By default, the AWS Distribution for the OpenTelemetry Collector has enabled exporting to AWS X-Ray without any additional 
configurations - converting the AWS X-Ray OTLP formatted trace data to the AWS X-Ray format and then exports this data to the AWS X-Ray 
service. For additional configuration options of the AWS X-Ray exporter in the Collector, you can find the comprehensive list 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration).

#### Example: 

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
exporters:
  awsxray:
    # you can add additional configuration here
    # for example configure sending traces to AWS X-Ray in a specific region
    region: us-west-2
```

*Note: These configurations are optional*

#### OTel to X-Ray data model translation behavior of AWS X-Ray Exporter

See [AWS X-Ray Segment Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html) for more information on the AWS X-Ray data model. See [OpenTelemetry data model spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification) for more information on OpenTelemetry data model.

### Enable The Customized X-Ray Annotations
By using OpenTelemetry SDK, we can add the customized attributes for each trace subsegment. By default, these OpenTelemetry
attributes will be converted into `metadata` attributes in X-Ray raw data. If we need to convert some or all OpenTelemetry attributes
into X-Ray `annotation`, we can follow the steps below for enabling annotation conversion.

#### Step 1: create an attribute by using OpenTelemetry SDK
For example:
```
setAttribute(“TransactionId”, <value>)
setAttribute(“AccountId”, <value>)
```
*Note: More detailed instructions for adding attributes can be found in individual languages' guides*
#### Step 2: In the collector, set the config in one of two ways
For specific attributes to be indexed:
```yaml lineNumbers=true
awsxray:
  indexed_attributes: ["TransactionId", "AccountId"]
```
For all attributes to be indexed:
```yaml lineNumbers=true
awsxray:
  index_all_attributes: true
```

## Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector for X-Ray remote Sampling

[AWS X-Ray remote sampling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html) is supported
with OpenTelemetry by configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector to proxy sampling requests to AWS X-Ray using the
`awsproxy` extension. Check out [Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector for X-Ray remote Sampling](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/remote-sampling) for more details.

## Sample Collector Configuration (Putting it Together)

This is a sample configuration without additional configurations in the exporter:

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  awsxray:

processors:
  memorylimiter:
    limit_mib: 100
    check_interval: 5s

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      processors:
        - memorylimiter
      receivers:
        - otlp
      exporters:
        - awsxray
```

## Using the ADOT SDKs

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry currently supports applications written in Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, and Python. Check out the Getting Started guides for the respective languages. 

* [Go](/docs/getting-started/go-sdk)
* [Java](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk)
* [JavaScript](/docs/getting-started/javascript-sdk)
* [.NET](/docs/getting-started/dotnet-sdk)
* [Python](/docs/getting-started/python-sdk)

If the OpenTelemetry Collector is configured correctly and an application is instrumented to generate traces, we should be able see the traces on the AWS X-Ray console.
