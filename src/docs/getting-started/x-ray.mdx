The OpenTelemetry Collector has three key components: the receiver, exporter, and processor. The receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector 
is responsible for receiving data via gRPC or HTTP using the 
[OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/otlp.md). 
The AWS X-Ray exporter available in the OpenTelemetry Collector converts OTLP formatted trace data to the AWS X-Ray format and then exports 
this data to the AWS X-Ray service. The processor component pre-processes data before it is exported, for example it is able to modify attributes, 
limit memory usage, or enable retries. 

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to configure the AWS Distro for the OpenTelemetry(ADOT) Collector for use with AWS X-Ray.

## Prerequisites

To get started using the ADOT Collector to connect with AWS X-Ray to analyze distributed traces, you have to first install AWS 
Distro for the OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector). Make sure you have your access key ID 
and secret access key properly configured in the docker file. You can generate access key ID and secret access key with the information 
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html).

In order to set up the ADOT Collector on a particular platform such as EKS, ECS, EC2 or on-premises, please see the Getting Started guide for

* [ECS](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/ecs)
* [EC2](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/ec2)
* [EKS](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/eks)
* [On-Premises](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/on-premises)

## Configuring the AWS X-Ray Receiver

To enable the OTLP receiver, we include the “otlp” flag in the definitions. You will have to set the “endpoint” consisting of `<host>:<port>` for 
the gRPC or HTTP protocols. You can change the endpoints depending on how you set up your instrumentation with OpenTelemetry.

#### Example:

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:55680
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:55681
```

*Note: A protocol can be disabled by not specifying it in the list of protocols. *

## Configuring the AWS X-Ray Exporter

By default, the AWS Distribution for the OpenTelemetry Collector has enabled exporting to AWS X-Ray without any additional 
configurations - converting the AWS X-Ray OTLP formatted trace data to the AWS X-Ray format and then exports this data to the AWS X-Ray 
service. For additional configuration options of the AWS X-Ray exporter in the Collector, you can find the comprehensive list 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration).

#### Example: 

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
exporters:
  awsxray:
    # you can add additional configuration here
    # for example configure sending traces to AWS X-Ray in a specific region
    region: us-west-2
```

*Note: These configurations are optional*

### Enable The Customer X-Ray Annotations
By using OpenTelemetry SDK, we can add the customized attributes for each trace subsegment. By default, these OTel attributes will be
converted into `metadta` attributes in X-Ray raw data. If we need to convert all of OTel attributes or the selected attributes
into X-Ray `annotation`. We can following the steps below for enabling annotation conversion.

#### Step 1: create an attribute by using OTel SDK
For example:
```
setAttribute(“TransactionId”, <value>)
setAttribute(“AccountId”, <value>)
```
#### Step 2: In the collector, set the config in one of the two ways
For specific attributes to be indexed
```yaml lineNumbers=true
awsxray:
  indexed_attributes: ["TransactionId", " AccountId "]
```
For all attributes to be indexed
```yaml lineNumbers=true
awsxray:
  index_all_attributes: true
```

## Configuring Processors

By default, there are no processors enabled by default. A processor pre-processes data before it is exported, for example modify attributes, 
limits memory usage, or enables retries. A processor must be enabled for every data source and a full list of processors can be found 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/processor/README.md#general-information).

#### Example:

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
processors:
  # you can define additional processors here
  # this configuration is used to place a limit on memory usage
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 100
    check_interval: 5s
```

## Sample Configuration (Putting it Together)

This is a sample configuration without additional configurations in the exporter:

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:55680
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:55681

exporters:
  awsxray:

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 100
    check_interval: 5s

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      processors:
        - memory_limiter
      receivers:
        - otlp
      exporters:
        - awsxray
```

## Using the Language SDKs

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) currently supports applications written in Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. Check out the Getting Started guides for the respective languages. 

* [Java](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk)
* [JavaScript](/docs/getting-started/javascript-sdk)
* [Python](/docs/getting-started/python-sdk)
* [Go](/docs/getting-started/go-sdk)

If the OpenTelemetry Collector is configured correctly and an application is instrumented to generate traces, we should be able see the traces on the AWS X-Ray console.
