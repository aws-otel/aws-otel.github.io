The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Python refers to some components developed to complement the upstream [OpenTelemetry (OTel) Python SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/tree/main/opentelemetry-sdk). Below are links to guides that go over how to configure the relevant components of the OpenTelemetry SDK to send trace data to the AWS X-Ray backend.
