## Overview

To collect Prometheus metrics from tasks running on ECS and send it to CloudWatch using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT).
You can either run the collector as a sidecar or deploy the collector as its own ECS service for entire cluster.
To use the pre-built dashboard in CloudWatch, you need to run a single collector for the entire cluster to attach task and service metadata.
ECS tasks with Prometheus endpoints are discovered using extension [ecsobserver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver).
(Unlike EKS, there is no builtin discovery for ECS [inside prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/main/discovery/aws))

## Steps

Follow these steps to run the ADOT Collector and Prometheus workload on ECS. You can skip some of them if you already have clusters or tasks running.

- Create an ECS cluster based on <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-cluster">tutorial</Link> or follow Appendix to [Create ECS cluster with EC2 instances using ecs-cli](#create-ecs-cluster-with-ec2-instances)
- Create <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-iam-role">IAM role</Link> and configure [IAM policy](#iam-policy). Discovery tasks requires extra ECS policies.
- Create [Configuration](#configuration) as an <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/config-through-ssm">SSM parameter</Link>
- Create [ECS Task Definition](#ecs-task-definition)
- Deploy [ADOT Collector](#deploy-collector) as a replica service with 1 replica
- Deploy [sample workloads](#sample-workloads)
- [View logs and metrics in the CloudWatch console](#view-logs-and-metrics-in-the-cloudwatch-console)
- [View pre-built CloudWatch dashboards](#view-pre-built-cloudwatch-dashboards)

## Permission

For discovering ECS tasks, you need to [config IAM policy](#iam-policy). For scraping discovered targets, you need to
[configure network](#network)

### IAM Policy

Extra IAM policies are required to discover ECS tasks with Prometheus metrics.
The full document with  <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-iam-policy">existing polices</Link> is included in the appendix [IAM Policy Document](#iam-policy-document).
NOTE: The `EC2` policy is required if you use ECS EC2 with `bridge` network mode. You can remove it if all your tasks are fargate or uses `awsvpc` network mode.

```text
ec2:DescribeInstances
ecs:ListTasks
ecs:ListServices
ecs:DescribeContainerInstances
ecs:DescribeServices
ecs:DescribeTasks
ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition
```

### Network

For the ADOT Collector to scrape metrics, connectivity between ECS tasks using private ip is required.
Depends on how the cluster is created, you may need to configure security group to allow ingress within current VPC as prometheus **pull** metrics.
The default VPC's security group normally allows ingress within VPC out of box, while some CLI tools such as [ecs-cli](#create-ecs-cluster-with-ec2-instances)
creates new VPC with stricter rules.

When defining inbound rules, you can specify a strict port range if your task is using `awsvpc` as the network mode
(ECS Fargate only use `awsvpc`). However, for ECS bridge network mode (only on EC2), the host port is random
so you have to allow inbound on all TCP ports within the VPC.

```bash
# Enable all TCP inbound within same VPC
SG=sg-123456
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id ${SG} --protocol tcp --port 0-65535 --source-group ${SG}
```

## Configuration

Configuring Container Insight Prometheus is similar to normal Prometheus pipeline.The overall flow of pipeline is:

- Extension `ecsobserver` call AWS API and write discovered targets to a file in a [folder that already exists](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/0134db77f6b4f1c8263e7423179a715cb233b485/cmd/awscollector/Dockerfile#L44) such as `/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml`.
A detailed explanation for `ecsobserver` config is in [its source](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver).
- The Prometheus receiver includes the output file from `ecsobserver` using `file_sd`.
- Prometheus relabel and EMF exporter's `metric_declarations` transform and select the right set of labels as CloudWatch dimensions.

A full example can be found in [examples/ecs/aws-cloudwatch/ecs-container-insights-prometheus.yaml](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/tree/main/examples/ecs/aws-cloudwatch/ecs-container-insights-prometheus.yaml).
It contains discovery and metrics extraction rule for all [workloads](#sample-workloads). NOTE: Remember to replace `{{cluster_name}}` in the example file.

Following is a small example for JMX and NGINX using service and docker label based discovery with inline comments.

```yaml

## Deploy ADOT Collector

ADOT Collector needs to run as single instance. We use the replica service because it handles task failure.
Replica is 1 otherwise we will have duplicated metrics.
If you have a large cluster, you can shard the scrape targets using `hashmod` or use different discovery configurations for multiple collectors.

```bash
# Run ADOT Collector as replica service on EC2
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-service.html
aws ecs create-service \
    --cluster my-ecs-cluster \
    --service-name adot-ecs-prometheus \
    --task-definition adot-ecs-prometheus:1 \
    --desired-count 1
```

## Sample Workloads

There are four workloads with pre-built dashboards, [JMX](#jmx) is the easiest to get started with.

### JMX

Details about example JMX workload can be found from CloudWatch docs [ECS JMX Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-ECS-javajmx.html)
and [ECS JMX Metrics Collected](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-metrics.html#ContainerInsights-Prometheus-metrics-jmx)

Our integration test also includes a [sample java app](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework/tree/terraform/sample-apps/jmx).

### NGINX

Detail about the example NGINX workload can be found from CloudWatch docs [ECS Nginx Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-nginx-ecs.html)
[nginx-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-prometheus-exporter) is an open source project.

### NGINX Plus

NGINX Plus is similar to [NGINX](#nginx) but requires subscription. Instruction for building image and run the workload can be found from CloudWatch docs [Build Nginx Plus Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-nginx-plus-ecs.html)

### AWS App Mesh

CloudWatch docs has a simple walk through [ECS App Mesh Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-ECS-appmesh.html).
Be aware it's not easy to set up Mesh. All the metrics (used in dashboard) are collected from Envoy.

## View logs and metrics in the CloudWatch console

The log group is named after cluster. For example, `/aws/ecs/containerinsights/my-cluster/prometheus`.
By default, the log stream name is `otel-stream` with a random suffix added.
The `_aws` part in log defines which fields are going to be extracted as metrics dimensions.
You can query all the fields using CloudWatch Logs [filter pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html#matching-terms-events)
or [Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html).

## View pre-built CloudWatch dashboards

Pre-built dashboards can be found from sidebar `Insights` > `Container Insights`.
Choose `Performance monitoring` from the drop-down and select your workload e.g. `ECS Prometheus Java/JMX`.
You should find your cluster on the right dropdown.

## Appendix

### Create ECS Cluster with EC2 instances

- Download [ecs-cli](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli#installing).
- Create a new cluster, take note of the security group and subnet it created.
- If you missed it, you can still find it from CloudFormation console, `ecs-cli` generates CloudFormation and applies it.
- To make testing easier, update security group to allow ingress on all TCP port within the cluster, this makes testing easier.
However, you might want to only allow specific port when you use non bridge network mode. Bridge network mode assigns random host ports so you have to allow all.
- Delete the cluster by either deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack or using `ecs-cli down -f -cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}`

```bash
# Create ECS EC2 cluster with 2 EC2 instances

export CLUSTER_NAME=aoc-containerinsight-prometheus-example
ecs-cli up --capability-iam --size 2 --instance-type t2.medium --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region us-west-2

# Output is like
# INFO[0000] Using recommended Amazon Linux 2 AMI with ECS Agent 1.51.0 and Docker version 19.03.13-ce
# INFO[0001] Created cluster                               cluster=aoc-containerinsight-prometheus-example region=us-west-2
# INFO[0001] Waiting for your cluster resources to be created...
# INFO[0122] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id ${SG} --protocol tcp --port 0-65535 --source-group ${SG}
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids ${SG}

    ]
}
```

### ECS Task Definition

NOTE: You need to replace placeholder values with actual value

- The account id in the example is `123456` and is used in ARN for taskRole and executionRole, replace it with your own AWS account id.
- `amazon/aws-otel-collector:v0.11.0` is using dockerhub (potential throttle) and you can use `latest` tag if you don't want to lock version.
- `/aoc/ecs-prometheus` is the name of <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/config-through-ssm">SSM parameter</Link>.
- `networkMode` can be `bridge`, `host`, `awsvpc`. For fargate, it has to be `awsvpc`.
- `logConfiguration` is for log from ADOT Collector itself. Log groups for metrics/log collected by collector is configured using `AOT_CONFIG_CONTENT`.
- `requiresCompatibilities` includes both EC2 and Fargate because ADOT Collector is scraping metrics via HTTP and does not need special host level access.
- `cpu` and `memory` must follow [Fargate's requirement]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html)
e.g. `cpu 255 memory 511` is invalid pair.
