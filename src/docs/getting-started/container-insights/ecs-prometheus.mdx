## Overview

In order to collect metrics from task running on ECS and send it to CloudWatch, you can either use a sidecar or run collector as ECS service for entire cluster.
For using pre-built dashboard in ClouDWatch Container Insights Prometheus, you have to run a single collector for entire cluster to attach task and service metadata.

ECS tasks with Prometheus endpoints are discovered using extension [ecsobserver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver).
(Unlike EKS, there is no builtin discovery for ECS [inside prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/main/discovery/aws))

## Steps

Follow these steps to run collector and Prometheus workload on ECS. You can skip some of them if you already have cluster or tasks running.

- Create ECS cluster based on <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-cluster">tutorial</Link> or use [ecs-cli](#create-ecs-cluster-with-ec2-instances)
- Create <Link to="docs/setup/ecs/create-iam-role">IAM role</Link> and configure [IAM policy](#iam-policy), discovery requires more policies.
- Create [Configuration](#configuration) as <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/config-through-ssm">SSM parameter</Link>
- Create [TaskDefinition](#ecs-task-definition)
- Launch collector as a [replica service](#deployment) with 1 replica
- Deploy [sample workloads](#sample-workloads)

## Permission

For discovering ECS tasks, you need to [config IAM policy](#iam-policy). For scraping discovered targets, you need to
[configure network](#network)

### IAM Policy

Extra IAM policies are required for discover ECS tasks with prometheus metrics.
Full document with  <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/create-iam-policy">existing polices</Link> is included in appendix [IAM Policy Document](#iam-policy-document).

NOTE: `ec2` policy is required if you use ECS EC2 with `bridge` network mode. You can remove it if all your tasks are fargate or uses `awsvpc` network mode.

```text
ec2:DescribeInstances
ecs:ListTasks
ecs:ListServices
ecs:DescribeContainerInstances
ecs:DescribeServices
ecs:DescribeTasks
ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition
```

### Network

For collector to scrape metrics, connectivity between ECS tasks using private ip is required.
Depends on how the cluster is created, you may need to configure security group to allow ingress within current VPC as prometheus **pull** metrics.
The default VPC's security group normally allows ingress within VPC out of box, while some cli tools creates new VPC with stricter rules,
e.g. [ecs-cli](#create-ecs-cluster-with-ec2-instances).

When defining inbound rules, you can specify a strict port range if your task is using `awsvpc` as network mode
(btw: ECS Fargate only use `awsvpc`). However, for ECS bridge network mode (only on EC2), host port is random
so you have to allow inbound on all TCP ports within the VPC.

```bash
# Enable all TCP inbound within same VPC
SG=sg-123456
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id ${SG} --protocol tcp --port 0-65535 --source-group ${SG}
```

## Configuration

Configuring Container Insight Prometheus is similar to normal Prometheus pipeline.The overall flow of pipeline is:

- Extension `ecsobserver` call AWS API and write discovered targets to a file in a [folder that already exists](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/0134db77f6b4f1c8263e7423179a715cb233b485/cmd/awscollector/Dockerfile#L44) e.g. `/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml`.
Detail explanation for `ecsobserver` config is in [its source](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver).
- Prometheus receiver include the output file from `ecsobserver` using file sd.
- Prometheus relabel and EMF exporter's metrics selection transform and select right set of labels as dimension.

Full example can be found in [examples/ecs/aws-cloudwatch/ecs-container-insights-prometheus.yaml](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/tree/main/examples/ecs/aws-cloudwatch/ecs-container-insights-prometheus.yaml).
It contains discovery and metrics extraction rule for all [workloads](#sample-workloads). NOTE: Remember to replace `{{cluster_name}}` in the example file.

Following is a small example for JMX and NGINX using service and docker label based discovery with inline comments.

```yaml

  ecs_observer: # extension type is ecs_observer
    cluster_name: 'my-ecs-cluster' # cluster name need to configured manually

```

## Deployment

Collector needs to run as single instance. We use replica service because it handles task failure.
Replica is 1 otherwise we will have duplicated metrics.

```bash
# Run collector as replica service on EC2
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-service.html
aws ecs create-service \
    --cluster my-ecs-cluster \
    --service-name adot-ecs-prometheus \
    --task-definition adot-ecs-prometheus:1 \
    --desired-count 1
```

## Sample Workloads

There are four workloads with pre-built dashboards, [JMX](#jmx) is the easiest to get started with.

### JMX

Detail on example JMX workload can be found from CloudWatch docs [ECS JMX Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-ECS-javajmx.html)
and [ECS JMX Metrics Collected](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-metrics.html#ContainerInsights-Prometheus-metrics-jmx)

Our integration test also includes a [sample java app](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework/tree/terraform/sample-apps/jmx).

### NGINX

Detail on example NGINX workload can be found from CloudWatch docs [ECS Nginx Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-nginx-ecs.html)
[nginx-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-prometheus-exporter) is an open source project.

### NGINX Plus

NGINX Plus is similar to [NGINX](#nginx) but requires subscription. Instruction for building image and run the workload can be found from CloudWatch docs [Build Nginx Plus Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-nginx-plus-ecs.html)

### AWS App Mesh

CloudWatch docs has a simple walk through [ECS App Mesh Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-ECS-appmesh.html).
Be aware it's not easy to set up Mesh. All the metrics (used in dashboard) are collected from Envoy.

## Appendix

### Create ECS Cluster with EC2 instances

- Download [ecs-cli](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli#installing).
- Create new cluster, take note of the security group and subnet it created.
- if you missed it, you can still find it from cloudformation console, ecs-cli generates cfn and applies it.
- Update security group to allow ingress on all tcp port within the cluster, this makes testing easier. However, you might
want to only allow specific port when using are using non bridge network mode. Bridge network mode assign random host port so you have to allow all.
- Delete the cluster by either delete the cfn stack or using `ecs-cli down -f -cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}`

```bash
# Create ECS EC2 cluster with 2 EC2 instances

export CLUSTER_NAME=aoc-containerinsight-prometheus-example
ecs-cli up --capability-iam --size 2 --instance-type t2.medium --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region us-west-2

# Output is like
# INFO[0000] Using recommended Amazon Linux 2 AMI with ECS Agent 1.51.0 and Docker version 19.03.13-ce
# INFO[0001] Created cluster                               cluster=aoc-containerinsight-prometheus-example region=us-west-2
# INFO[0001] Waiting for your cluster resources to be created...
# INFO[0122] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
# VPC created: vpc-0fcxxxxx
# Security Group created: sg-04xxxxx
# Subnet created: subnet-03xxxx
# Subnet created: subnet-0exxxx
# Cluster creation succeeded.

# Update security group to allow ingress on all ports within security group
SG=sg-04xxxxx
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id ${SG} --protocol tcp --port 0-65535 --source-group ${SG}
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids ${SG}
```

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### ECS Task Definition

NOTE: You need to replace placeholder values with actual value

- account id is `123456` and used in ARN for taskRole and executionRole, replace it with your own AWS account id.
- `amazon/aws-otel-collector:v0.11.0` is using dockerhub (potential throttle) and may not be the latest version.
- `/aoc/ecs-prometheus` is the name of <Link to="/docs/setup/ecs/config-through-ssm">SSM parameter</Link>.
- `networkMode` can be `bridge`, `host`, `awsvpc`. For fargate, it has to be `awsvpc`.
- `logConfiguration` is for log from collector itself, log group for metrics/log collected by collector is configured using `AOT_CONFIG_CONTENT`.
- `requiresCompatibilities` includes both EC2 and Fargate because collector is scraping metrics via HTTP and does not need special host level access.
- `cpu` and `memory` must follow [Fargate's requirement]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html)
e.g. `cpu 255` `memory 511` is invalid pair.
