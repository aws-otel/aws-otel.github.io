This section explains how to set up Prometheus monitoring with the ADOT Collector in a cluster running Amazon EKS or Kubernetes. With [default configurations](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/tree/main/config/eks/prometheus), the ADOT Collector automatically scrapes and imports metrics for the following workloads running in a cluster.
* [AppMesh](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/container-insights-eks-app-mesh.md#install-app-mesh-and-sample-applications)
* [HAProxy](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/container-insights-eks-haproxy.md#install-haproxy)
* [JMX](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/container-insights-eks-jmx.md)
* [Memcached](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/container-insights-eks-memcached.md#install-memcached)
* [Nginx](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/container-insights-eks-nginx.md#install-nginx)

To deploy these sample workloads, please follow the above links for guidance.

## Set Up IAM Policy
To use the ADOT Collector to collect Prometheus metrics, make sure the following policies are attached to your node instance role.

```bash
AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy
AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly
CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy
AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess
AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess
AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
AmazonPrometheusFullAccess
```

## Deploy the ADOT Collector with default configuration
The default [all-in-one configuration](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/tree/main/config/eks/prometheus)  is built into the image of ADOT Collector and can be used to collect Prometheus metrics for all the sample workloads.

1. Set up variables to export metrics of your EKS cluster to the region where the logs should be published to.
```
export CLUSTER_NAME=<eks-cluster-name>
export AWS_REGION=<aws-region>
```

1. Download the example deployment file [otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/deployment-template/eks/otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml).

1. Deploy it to the cluster.
    ```bash
    cat otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml |
    sed "s/{{region}}/$AWS_REGION/g" | 
    sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/$CLUSTER_NAME/g" |
    kubectl apply -f - 
    ```

1. Check the resources in the `aws-otel-eks` namespace.
    * Make sure Pods are running.
    ```bash
    kubectl get all -naws-otel-eks
    ```
    * You should be able to see the message `Everything is ready. Begin running and processing data` by fetching logs from the Pod if the ADOT Collector is started correctly.
    ```bash
    kubectl logs -naws-otel-eks $POD_NAME
    ```

## Customize the ADOT Collector
To collect Prometheus metrics that are different from those specified in the default configuration, you can configure ADOT Collector with your own configuration.

### Prepare Customized Configuration
1. In general, the `processors` section should be the same as what is shown below. 
  ```
  processors:
    resourcedetection/ec2:
      detectors: [ env ]
      timeout: 2s
      override: false
    resource:
      attributes:
        - key: TaskId
          from_attribute: job
          action: insert
        - key: receiver
          value: "prometheus"
          action: insert
  ```
    * `resourcedetection/ec2` is a processor that reads environment variables and converts them to resource attributes. 
      In the example of [otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/deployment-template/eks/otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml),
      it injects `ClusterName` which is later used by awsemf exporter to generate `log_group_name` .
    * `resource` is a processor that injects additional resource attributes. We copy the value from `job` to `TaskId` to generate `log_stream_name`. The attribute `receiver: prometheus` is an identifier for optimizing
      Prometheus metrics before awsemf exporter sending metric logs to CloudWatch.

1. Create ConfigMap `otel-config` in the `aws-otel-eks` namespace with your customized configuration so that it can be consumed by aws-otel-collector Pods.
  
  Be sure to rename `{{filename}}` with the actual filename.
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap otel-config --from-file={{filename}} -naws-otel-eks
  ```

### Run ADOT Collector
Edit `otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml` with the following changes:

1. Add volume `otel-config`.
   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
   ...
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     ...
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         ...
         volumes:
         - configMap:
             defaultMode: 420
             name: otel-config
           name: otel-config
   ```

1. Mount volume to the container and define command and arguments. 

   Make sure that `{{filename}}` matches the key in the `otel-config` ConfigMap.
   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
   ...
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     ...
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: aws-otel-collector
           command: ["/awscollector"]
           args: [ "--config", "/etc/otel/{{filename}}"]
           ...
           volumeMounts:
           - mountPath: /etc/otel/
             name: otel-config
             readOnly: true
         volumes:
         - configMap:
             defaultMode: 420
             name: otel-config
           name: otel-config
  ```

1. Finally roll out the updated deployment to the EKS cluster.
  ```bash
  cat otel-container-insights-prometheus.yaml |
  sed "s/{{region}}/$AWS_REGION/g" | 
  sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/$CLUSTER_NAME/g" |
  kubectl apply -f - 
  ```

## View Your Data

1. View your Container Insights auto-dashboard

   Open the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). In the AWS Region where your cluster is
   running, choose `Container Insights - Performance monitoring` in the navigation panel. Then
   select `EKS Prometheus {{workload_type}}` and `{{cluster_name}}` from the drop down menu in the main panel.

2. View Your Metrics

   To see the CloudWatch metrics, choose Metrics in the navigation panel. The metric are in the
   `ContainerInsights/Prometheus` namespace.

   <img src={metricsImg} alt="cloudwatch console log" style="margin: 30px 0;"/>

3. View your logs

   To see the CloudWatch Logs events, choose Log groups in the navigation panel. The events are in the log group `/aws/containerinsights/{{cluster_name}}/prometheus`.
