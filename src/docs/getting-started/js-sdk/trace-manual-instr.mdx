## Introduction

This project contains components of the OpenTelemetry Javascript SDK for OpenTelemetry, a framework to collect traces
and metrics from applications. In order to trace data from various web applications, OpenTelemetry provides plugins to
automatically trace data from web applications. As OpenTelemetry does not recognize AWS X-Ray as an officially supported
backend, configurations have to be made in the `NodeTracerProvider` provided by the OpenTelemetry API.

The data path of exporting to AWS X-Ray starts from instrumenting an app with our configured tracer, export traces to
collector, and the collector will export to AWS X-Ray.

### What is AWSXRayIdGenerator?

By default, OpenTelemetry uses purely random trace IDs, which differs from AWS X-Ray where the first 4 bytes of the trace
ID must be set to the start time of the trace. OpenTelemetry provides an extension point, `IdGenerator` to allow us to
use a custom generator that conforms to the [X-Ray requirement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-sendingdata.html).
We implemented an [AWS XRay IdGenerator](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-id-generator-aws-xray)
which generates traces with the first 8 hexadecimals set to the start time according to AWS X-Ray trace ID format.

### What is AWSXRayPropagator?

By default, OpenTelemetry uses the W3C Trace Context format for propagating spans, and out-of-the-box supports B3 and
Jaeger propagation. The `HttpTextFormat` interface allows other propagators to be implemented, so we implemented a
propagator that conforms with
the [X-Ray trace header format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader).
We implemented an [AWS Propagator](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-propagator-aws-xray) which
conforms the propagation headers to the AWS X-Ray format.

Further information about OpenTelemetry can be found in the upstream [repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js).

We will provide a sample, to instrument an Express application with traces conforming to AWS X-Ray.

## Requirements

[Node JS v8.50 (or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry.

Note: You’ll also need to have the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector running to export traces to X-Ray.
See the <Link to="/docs/getting-started/collector">AWS OTel Collector documentation</Link> for setup instructions.

## Getting the SDK and Dependencies

In order to trace your application, the following OpenTelemetry packages will be required to be installed in your applications main directory.

```bash lineNumbers=true
$ npm install \
  @opentelemetry/api \
  @opentelemetry/node \
  @opentelemetry/resources \
  @opentelemetry/tracing \
  @opentelemetry/exporter-collector
```

Install the AWS X-Ray components.

```bash lineNumbers=true
$ npm install \
  @aws/otel-aws-xray-propagator \
  @aws/otel-aws-xray-id-generator
```

To install a specific version, see the [release tags on the Github releases page](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js/releases).

## Instrumenting a Library

OpenTelemetry can collect tracing data from various applications automatically using plugins.
The [OpenTelemetry upstream repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js#plugins) contains the list of
supported modules, libraries, and installation instructions.

OpenTelemetry Express Instrumentation allows the user to automatically collect trace data and export them to their backend
of choice, to give observability with distributed systems. An example of how to instrument an Express application is given below:

**All of the configuration code in this getting started should be place in the same file;** create a `tracer.js` file:

```
touch tracer.js
```

To load the express plugin, specify it in the Node Tracer’s configuration and set the flag enabled to true:

```javascript title=tracer.js lineNumbers=true
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/node');

module.exports = (serviceName) => {
    const tracerConfig = {
        plugins: {
         express: {
          enabled: true,
           // You may use a package name or absolute path to the file.
          path: '@opentelemetry/plugin-express',
          }
        }
    }
    const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider(tracerConfig);

    return trace.getTracer("example-tracer")
}
```

## Configure Global Tracer for AWS X-Ray

The Global Tracer configuration for AWS X-Ray is uniform for all applications. This can be configured within
the `tracer.js` file above with appropriate AWS X-Ray configs. Included in this repository, we can use our custom
IdGenerator, Propagator, and Resource detectors.

### Configuration

The following will set the tracer’s global propagator to the AWS X-Ray propagator to conform to AWS X-Ray trace header’s.
Also within the tracerConfig, we can set the idGenerator to use the AWSXRayIdGenerator.

```javascript title=tracer.js lineNumbers=true
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/node');
const { SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/tracing");
const { CollectorTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-collector');

const { AWSXRayPropagator } = require('@aws/otel-aws-xray-propagator');
const { AwsXRayIdGenerator } = require('@aws/otel-aws-xray-id-generator');


// const { AwsXRayPropagator } = require('@aws-observability/propagator-aws-xray');
// const { AwsXRayIdGenerator } = require('@aws-observability/id-generator-aws-xray');

const { context, propagation, trace } = require("@opentelemetry/api");

module.exports = (serviceName) => {
    // set global propagator
    propagation.setGlobalPropagator(new AWSXRayPropagator());

    const tracerConfig = {
        //
        idGenerator: new AwsXRayIdGenerator();
        plugins: {
        }
    }
    const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider(tracerConfig);

    return trace.getTracer("example-xray-tracer")
}
```

#### Export Trace Data to OTLP exporter

To export to AWS X-Ray we setup an OTLP exporter which is configured to send data to
an [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md)
at `localhost:55680`. The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector to export traces to X-Ray should be setup as a part of the
requirements. The setup for the OTLP exporter will set up within the `tracer.js` after the `tracerProvider` is instantiated.

```javascript title=tracer.js lineNumbers=true
const otlpExporter = new CollectorTraceExporter({
    serviceName: serviceName,
    protocolNode: 2,
  });
  tracerProvider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(otlpExporter));
  tracerProvider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter()));
```

Next, start the application to specify the required tracing module via the -r flag.

```
$ node -r ./tracer.js app
```

#### Adding Custom Attributes

You can add custom attributes to a `Span` by defining an `AttributeKey` and calling `setAttribute`
on the current `Span`. The JS SDK creates spans via it’s supported web framework plugins. You
use `TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan()` to access the current span and set the attribute for a key that you have
defined as a constant by using `AttributeKeys`.

```javascript title=tracer.js lineNumbers=true
const { context, propagation, trace } = require("@opentelemetry/api");

const tracer = require('./xray-tracer')('your app name');

//...

function SetSpanAttribute() {
  const span = tracer.getCurrentSpan()
  String exampleAttribute = exampleAttribute();
  TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan().setAttribute(EXAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE, exampleAttribute);
}
```

Note: When using AWS X-Ray as your tracing backend, you can control whether attributes are uploaded as annotations or
metadata by configuring the AWS OTel Collector’s
[indexed keys](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration).
Additionally, you can set attributes as annotations or metadata in code by using `setAttribute(“annotation.<key>”, <value>)`
and `setAttribute(“metadata.<key>”, <value>)`.

#### Creating Spans

Spans can be manually created using the standard OpenTelemetry API as well.

```javascript title=tracer.js lineNumbers=true
const span = tracer.startSpan('op');
//...
span.end();
```
