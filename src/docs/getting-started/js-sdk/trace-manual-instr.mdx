## Introduction

In this Getting Started guide, we will introduce how to instrument a JavaScript application for traces to use with an AWS X-Ray backend.

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) contains some components from the upstream OpenTelemetry Javascript SDK. This SDK collects traces 
and metrics from applications. OpenTelemetry provides plugins to automatically trace data from multiple web applications. As OpenTelemetry 
is not configured for AWS X-Ray by default, configuration has to be made in the `NodeTracerProvider` provided by the OpenTelemetry API.

The diagram above shows the data path of exporting from an application instrumented with OpenTelemetry to AWS X-Ray. It starts with instrumenting 
our app with a configured tracer, then we export traces to the collector, and finally, the collector will export to AWS X-Ray.

### What is AWSXRayIdGenerator?

By default, OpenTelemetry uses the standard W3C trace format which generates a purely random trace ID. This differs from the traceID format that 
AWS X-Ray uses where the first 4 bytes of the trace ID represents the start time of the trace. OpenTelemetry provides an extension point for us 
to use the AWS X-Ray `IdGenerator` to allow us to use a custom generator that conforms to the 
[X-Ray requirement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-sendingdata.html). We 
[implemented an AWS XRay IdGenerator](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-id-generator-aws-xray) 
which generates traces with the first 8 hexadecimals set to the start time according to AWS X-Ray trace ID format.

### What is AWSXRayPropagator?

By default, OpenTelemetry uses the W3C Trace Context format for propagating spans, and out-of-the-box supports B3 and Jaeger propagation. 
The `HttpTextFormat` interface allows other propagators to be implemented, so we implemented an 
[AWS Propagator](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-propagator-aws-xray)that conforms 
with the [X-Ray trace header format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader). 

<SubSectionSeparator />

### What is a Resource?

A resource, defined by OpenTelemetry, is an immutable representation of the entity producing telemetry. For example, a process running in a 
container on Kubernetes may have a container name, container ID, and namespace. All of these attributes can be included in a resource object. 
When a resource is defined and registered with the tracer provider, all spans produced by the Tracer will automatically include the resource attributes.

More information about OpenTelemetry can be found in the OpenTelemetry [specifications](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/resource/sdk.md).

## Requirements

[Node JS v8.50 (or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry.

Note: You’ll also need to have the ADOT Collector running to export traces to AWS X-Ray. See the ADOT Collector 
[documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) for setup instructions.

<SectionSeparator />

## Installing the SDK and Dependencies

In order to trace your application, the following OpenTelemetry packages will be required to be installed in your applications main directory.

```bash
$ npm install \
  @opentelemetry/api \
  @opentelemetry/node \
  @opentelemetry/tracing \
  @opentelemetry/exporter-collector-grpc
```

Install the AWS X-Ray components.

```bash
$ npm install \
  @aws-observability/propagator-aws-xray \
  @aws-observability/id-generator-aws-xray
```

To install a specific version, see the [release tags on the Github releases page](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js/releases).

## Instrumenting an Application

OpenTelemetry can collect tracing data from various applications automatically using plugins. The plugins offer instrumenting popular frameworks such as 
Hapi, Express, Redis, GraphQL, and many more. The full list of supported libraries and installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib#node-plugins).

OpenTelemetry allows the user to automatically collect telemetry data and export them to the backend of choice, to give observability with 
distributed systems. We will be going through how to instrument a simple HTTP server below.

### Configure Global Tracer for AWS X-Ray

The following tracer configuration file for AWS X-Ray is uniform for all applications and the following code can be copied into a file named `tracer.js`:

*Note: Any additional configurations will be modified in here.*

```javascript lineNumbers=true 
const { SimpleSpanProcessor } = require("@opentelemetry/tracing");
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/node');
const { CollectorTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-collector-grpc');
const { AWSXRayPropagator } = require('AWSXRayPropagator');
const { AwsXRayIdGenerator } = require('AWSXRayIdGenerator');
const { propagation, trace } = require("@opentelemetry/api");

module.exports = (serviceName) => {
  // set global propagator
  propagation.setGlobalPropagator(new AWSXRayPropagator());

  // create a provider for activating and tracking with AWS IdGenerator
  const tracerConfig = {
    idGenerator: new AwsXRayIdGenerator(),
  // Any instrumentation plugins will be declared here
    plugins: {},
  // Any resources can be declared here
    resources: {},
  };
  const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider(tracerConfig);

  // add OTLP exporter
  const otlpExporter = new CollectorTraceExporter({
    serviceName: serviceName,
  // can send to any port configured in the collector config
    url: "localhost:55680"
  });
  tracerProvider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(otlpExporter));

  // Register the tracer
  tracerProvider.register();

  // Return an tracer instance
  return trace.getTracer("sample-instrumentation");
}
```

### Sample Application 

For this guide, we will be tracing a sample hello-world application and this code can be copied into a file named `server.js`

```javascript lineNumbers=true 
'use strict';
const tracer = require('./tracer')('');
const http = require('http');

/** Starts a HTTP server that receives requests on localhost:8080. */
function startServer(address) {
  // Creates a server
  const server = http.createServer(handleRequest);
  // Starts the server
  server.listen(address, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }
    console.log(`Node HTTP listening on ${address}`);
  });
}

function handleRequest(req, res) {  
   try {
    req.on('error', (err) => console.log(err));
    req.on('data', (chunk) => body.push(chunk));
    req.on('end', () => {
        res.end('Hello World!');
      });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

startServer(8080);
```

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Start Tracing

All that has to be done now is to declare the tracer at the top of your application file, i.e. `server.js`

```
const tracer = require('./tracer')('your app name');
```

Start application via terminal:

```
node server.js
```

Whenever a request is made to the application, the tracer will automatically collect telemetry data from the application, export to 
the collector, and the collector will send traces AWS X-Ray.

Visit the sample application via url localhost:8080:

<img src={jsImg1} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

If the collector has been set up successfully with the proper endpoints, AWS credentials and the application is instrumented correctly, 
we should see the following in the AWS X-Ray console:

<img src={jsImg2} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

This trace can be analyzed by clicking into it:

<img src={jsImg3} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

## Additional Configurations

As shown in the example, it is very easy to start instrumenting a simple HTTP application. This section includes the usage of plugins to instrument different 
libraries, adding resources to populate traces with information about the entity, adding custom attributes, and manually creating spans.

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Adding Resources

Adding resources to the traces will provide more information and insight about the application. In particular, there are multiple resource detectors 
which add information about the environment in the traces. This includes the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes service, Elastic Container Service, Elastic 
Compute Cloud, and AWS Beanstalk. If your application is deployed on any of the named services, you may want to include these resource detectors to include 
additional information about the environment themselves; this may include containerID, container name, version and deployment ID.

Install the following dependency with npm:

```
npm install --save @opentelemetry/resource-detector-aws \
                   @opentelemetry/resources
```

Import the dependencies in `tracer.js`:

```
const { awsEc2Detector, awsEksDetector, awsEcsDetector, awsBeanstalkDetector } = require('@opentelemetry/resource-detector-aws');
const { detectResources } = require('@opentelemetry/resources/build/src/platform/node/detect-resources');
```

Detect the resources using the code snippet:

``` javascript lineNumbers=true 
var resources;
  detectResources({ detectors: [awsEc2Detector, awsEksDetector, awsEcsDetector, awsBeanstalkDetector] })
  .then((res) => {
    resources = res;
    console.log("detected resource: " + JSON.stringify(resources));
  }).catch((e) => {console.log(e);});
```

Include the plugin in the provided `tracer.js` template:

```
resources: resources,
```

The tracer will automatically include any resource information into its traces once an application is instrumented. Only include the specific 
resource detector if your application is hosted on the corresponding Amazon service to reduce overhead. However, the detectors will not throw an 
error or include unexpected information if it is declared and the application is not running in the corresponding environment.

### Instrumenting Different Frameworks

The full list of supported plugins and installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib#node-plugins). For example, to start instrumenting an express:

Install the following dependency with npm:

```
npm install --save @opentelemetry/plugin-express
```

Include the plugin in the provided tracer.js template:

```json 
  // Any instrumentation plugins will be declared here
    plugins: {
      express: {
      enabled: true,
      // You may use a package name or absolute path to the file.
      path: '@opentelemetry/plugin-express',
    }
  }
```

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Tracing AWS SDK Calls

Tracing support to any AWS SDK calls such as Amazon DynamoDB, S3, and etc is provided by the 
[Open Telemetry AWS SDK Instumentation plugin](https://github.com/aspecto-io/opentelemetry-ext-js/tree/master/packages/plugin-aws-sdk) by [aspecto.io](https://www.aspecto.io/).

Install the following dependency with npm:

```
npm install --save opentelemetry-plugin-aws-sdk
```

Include the plugin in the provided tracer.js template:

```json lineNumbers=true 
  plugins: {
    "aws-sdk": {
      enabled: true,
      // You may use a package name or absolute path to the file.
      path: "opentelemetry-plugin-aws-sdk",
    },
```

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Adding Custom Attributes

You can add custom attributes to a `Span` by defining an `AttributeKey` and calling `setAttribute`
on the current `Span`. The JavaScript SDK creates spans via it’s supported web framework plugins. You can use 
`TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan()` to access the current span and set the attribute for a key that you have defined as a constant by using `AttributeKeys`.

```javascript lineNumbers=true 
const { context, propagation, trace } = require("@opentelemetry/api");

const tracer = require('./xray-tracer')('your app name');

//...

function SetSpanAttribute() {
  const span = tracer.getCurrentSpan()
  String exampleAttribute = exampleAttribute();
  TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan().setAttribute(EXAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE, exampleAttribute);
}
```

*Note: When using AWS X-Ray as your tracing backend, you can control whether attributes are uploaded as annotations or metadata by configuring the ADOT 
Collector’s [indexed keys](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration). 
Additionally, you can set attributes as annotations or metadata in code by using `setAttribute(“annotation.<key>”, <value>)` and `setAttribute(“metadata.<key>”, <value>)`.*

#### Creating Spans

Spans can be manually created using the standard OpenTelemetry API. This will be modified in the application code to do any manual span instrumentation, 
you may desire to inquire more information about a certain request, etc.

```javascript lineNumbers=true 
const span = tracer.startSpan('op');
//...
span.end();
```
