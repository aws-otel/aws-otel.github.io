## Manual Steps for Private Lambda Layers

See the documentation on the [OpenTelemetry Lambda repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-lambda/).

The OpenTelemetry Lambda repository provides comprehensive instructions for:

- Building and deploying your own private Lambda layers
- Customizing the layer configuration for your specific needs
- Advanced deployment scenarios and troubleshooting

For organizations that need to create private or customized Lambda layers, the OpenTelemetry Lambda repository contains the source code and build instructions necessary to create your own layers with specific configurations or modifications.
