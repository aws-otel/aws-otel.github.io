## Custom configuration for the ADOT Collector on Lambda

The ADOT Lambda layers combines both OpenTelemetry SDK and the ADOT Collector components.
The configuration of the ADOT Collector follows the OpenTelemetry standard.
By default, the ADOT Lambda layer uses [config.yaml](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-lambda/blob/main/adot/collector/config.yaml),
which exports telemetry data to AWS X-Ray.

Please find the list of available components supported for custom configuration [here](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-lambda/blob/main/README.md#adot-lambda-layer-available-components). To enable debugging, you can use the configuration file to set log level to debug. See the example below.

## Confmap Providers

The ADOT Lambda Layers supports the following types of confmap providers: file, env, yaml, http, https and s3. To customize the ADOT collector configuration using different Confmap providers, Please refer to [Confmap providers](/docs/components/confmap-providers#confmap-providers-supported-by-the-adot-collector) section for more information.

Once your collector configuration is set through a `confmap` providers.
Create an environment variable on your Lambda function `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_URI` and set the path of configuration w.r.t to the confmap provider as its value. for e.g, if you are using a file configmap provider, set its value to `/var/task/*<path/<to>/<filename>*`.
This will tell the extension where to find the collector configuration.

## Sample Configuration

Here is a sample configuration file of collector.yaml in the root directory:

```yaml
#collector.yaml in the root directory
#Set an environment variable 'OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_URI' to '/var/task/collector.yaml'

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "localhost:4317"
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"

exporters:
  debug:
  awsxray:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [awsxray]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [debug]
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888

```

## Setting Configuration via Lambda Console

You can set this via the Lambda console, or via the AWS CLI.

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name Function --environment Variables={OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_URI=/var/task/collector.yaml}
```

## CloudFormation Configuration

You can configure environment variables via **CloudFormation** template as well:

```yaml
Function:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    ...
    Environment:
      Variables:
        OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_URI: /var/task/collector.yaml
```

## S3 Configuration

Also, to load configuration from an S3 object

```yaml
  Function:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      ...
      Environment:
        Variables:
          OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_URI: s3://<bucket_name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/collector_config.yaml
```

Loading configuration from S3 will require that the IAM role attached to your function includes read access to the relevant bucket.

Here is a [blogpost](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/auto-instrumenting-a-python-application-with-an-aws-distro-for-opentelemetry-lambda-layer/) which provides more context about the setup with an example for adding the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda layer to the Lambda function.
