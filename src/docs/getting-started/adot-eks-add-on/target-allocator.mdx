Installing the EKS Add-on gives you access to the Target Allocator (TA). Enabling the Target Allocator for an
OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource decouples Prometheus service discovery and metrics collection. When enabled,
the Target Allocator manages the configuration of the Prometheus receiver. Specifically,
the Target Allocator allows for distribution of Prometheus scrape targets across a pool of Collectors. This functionality can
be used to avoid the manual sharding of Prometheus scrape targets that can be required when horizontally scaling
a single Prometheus receiver configuration.
Visit the [Target Allocator Readme](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/cmd/otel-allocator/README.md)
for a deeper introduction. 

## Out of Order Samples

In some cases the Target Allocator can be used to solve Prometheus remote write out of order sample errors. A common
reason Collector users will see out of order sample erorrs is due to multiple collectors scraping the same metric
endpoint. Collector users may experience this when horizontally scaling Collectors with Prometheus 
receivers or daemonset deployments without manually sharding scrape targets. Both of these scenarios can lead to
out of order sample erorrs without sharding of Prometheus scrape targets.

## Getting Started

Enabling the target allocator requires setting `OpenTelemeteryCollector.spec.targetAllocator.enabled` to `true`.
This will cause the Prometheus configuration within the Collector CRD to be rewritten to use an `http_sd_config`
from the Target Allocator. The operator will also create a new deployment and service for this http_sd_config
directive.
