## Updating ADOT using EKS add-ons and Updating the Collector Custom Resource

The ADOT Operator and Collector Custom Resource are periodically updated with new versions. Check for an update of the ADOT Operator version EKS add-ons uses by executing the command
```console
aws eks describe-addon-versions â€”addon-name adot
```

Refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-kube-proxy.html) for more information. If a new version is found, update it in your cluster with the command 
```console
aws eks update-addon --addon-name adot --addon-version new-addon-version --cluster-name <your_cluster_name>
```

After updating the ADOT Operator using EKS add-ons, the Collector CR will also have been updated, as the default ADOT Collector image the ADOT Operator uses will have been updated as well. Reapply the Collector configurations with any changes from the last Collector Custom Resource Definition, if necessary.

### Updating ADOT using EKS add-ons advanced configuration feature

If you followed steps from [Add-on Advanced Configuration](/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on/add-on-configuration), then you can update ADOT using EKS add-ons advanced configuration feature as well. You can execute the command
```console
aws eks update-addon --addon-name adot --addon-version new-addon-version --cluster-name <your_cluster_name> --configuration-values <your_configuration_values> 
```

Updating the configuration values used by the add-on with a new JSON string will override previously set configuration values. If you would like to reset the configuration values used back to default values, you can use an empty JSON string (`--configuration-values "{}"`).

ADOT can also be updated to a new add-on version alongside updates to configuration values. However, the configuration values must be compatible with the add-on version that ADOT is being updated to; the add-on will not update if those configuration values are not available in the new version.

## Cleanup of ADOT using EKS Add-ons and Cleanup of Other Components

### Delete the Collector resource

You can delete individual services by specifying their YAML:
```console
kubectl delete -f collector-config-(amp|cloudwatch|xray|advanced).yaml
```

### Uninstall ADOT using EKS Add-Ons

```console
aws eks delete-addon --addon-name adot --cluster-name your-cluster-name
```

After uninstalling ADOT, before reinstalling you must reinstall permissions first, see [this page](/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on/requirements#adot-requirements).

### Uninstall cert-manager

Uninstall the cert-manager by following the instructions [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/#uninstalling).

## Questions or bugs?

Technical documentation is available on the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry [developer site](https://aws-otel.github.io/), and you can [download the distribution from GitHub](https://aws-otel.github.io/download). You can also download the latest [ADOT Collector image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) from the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) Public Gallery.

To learn more about how you can use ADOT to collect data for your observability solution, check out the hands-on [AWS Observability workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/v2/workshops/31676d37-bbe9-4992-9cd1-ceae13c5116c/en-US/adot). If you have questions about the distribution, features, or components, file an [issue](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-community/issues).
