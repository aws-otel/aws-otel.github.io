## Updating ADOT using EKS add-ons and Updating the Collector Custom Resource

The ADOT Operator and Collector Custom Resource are periodically updated with new versions. Check for an update of the ADOT Operator version EKS add-ons uses by executing the command
```console
aws eks describe-addon-versions —addon-name adot
```

Refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-kube-proxy.html) for more information. If a new version is found, update it in your cluster with the command 
```console
aws eks update-addon --addon-name adot --addon-version new-addon-version --cluster-name <your_cluster_name>
```

After updating the ADOT Operator using EKS add-ons, the Collector CR will also have been updated, as the default ADOT Collector image the ADOT Operator uses will have been updated as well. Reapply the Collector configurations with any changes from the last Collector Custom Resource Definition, if necessary.

## Cleanup of ADOT using EKS Add-ons and Cleanup of Other Components

### Delete the Collector resource

You can delete individual services by specifying their YAML:
```console
kubectl delete -f collector-config-(amp|cloudwatch|xray|advanced).yaml
```

### Uninstall ADOT using EKS Add-Ons

```console
aws eks delete-addon --addon-name adot --cluster-name your-cluster-name
```

After uninstalling ADOT, before reinstalling you must reinstall permissions first, see [this page](/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on/requirements#adot-requirements).

### Uninstall cert-manager

Uninstall the cert-manager by following the instructions [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/#uninstalling).
