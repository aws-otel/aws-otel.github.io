> **IMPORTANT**: This EKS add-on Advanced Configuration for ADOT is for version `v0.88.0-eksbuild.1` and on.

EKS add-ons provides the ability to configure the installation of ADOT, during installation time. During add-on creation, or add-on updates, configurable values can be used to modify the add-on to your liking. Some examples include modifying resource requests or limits or adding tolerations to the deployed pod. 

These configuration values are passed in as a JSON string to a `--configuration-values` option when creating or updating ADOT using EKS add-ons. you can either pass in a JSON string directly, or you can pass a file path to a JSON file as a parameter, see [these docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-file.html) for more information. For example, to set the cpu resource limit to 200m during add-on creation, the command would look like

```console
aws eks create-addon \
    --cluster-name <YOUR-EKS-CLUSTER-NAME> \
    --addon-name adot \
    --configuration-values "{\"manager\":{\"resources\":{\"limits\":{\"cpu\":\"200m\"}}}}" \
    --resolve-conflicts=OVERWRITE
```

Note that, when passing in JSON directly, you must escape special characters, such as double quotes. This is reflected in the example above. Alternatively, you can pass in a file path as an argument to `--configuration-values`, reducing the need for special formatting. For example, the same command above using a file named `configuration-values.json` as a file path would look like

```console
aws eks create-addon \
    --cluster-name <YOUR-EKS-CLUSTER-NAME> \
    --addon-name adot \
    --configuration-values file://configuration-values.json \
    --resolve-conflicts=OVERWRITE
```

```json
// configuration-values.json
{
  "manager": {
    "resource": {
      "limits": {
        "cpu": "200m"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each EKS add-on version of ADOT will have itâ€™s own definition of what values are configurable.  To see what configurable values are available for an add-on version, use the command 

```console
aws eks describe-addon-configuration --addon-name adot --addon-version <DESIRED-ADDON-VERSION> 
```
