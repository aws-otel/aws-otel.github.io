## Collector Configuration

The Collector configuration below is set up to receive OTLP traces and export to X-Ray.  The OTLP Receiver in the traces pipeline accepts data via gRPC or HTTP using [OTLP format](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md). It is configured to receive via gRPC on the `host:port 0.0.0.0:4317` and via HTTP on `0.0.0.0:4318`. Per this configuration, workloads that want to send trace data to this receiver should be configured to send to the endpoint `my-collector-xray-collector:4317` for gRPC and `my-collector-xray-collector:4318` for HTTP.  The X-Ray exporter sends these segments directly to X-Ray using the [PutTraceSegments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_PutTraceSegments.html) API. Note that segments or spans ingested by the OTLP receiver must be in [X-Ray Segment format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html). Note that the file below is also hosted [here](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-community/blob/master/sample-configs/operator/collector-config-xray.yaml). Save this into a file called `collector-config-xray.yaml` and execute the command
```console
kubectl apply -f collector-config-xray.yaml
```
to deploy your Collector.  Make sure to replace `<YOUR_AWS_REGION>` in the `awsxray` exporter config, as per your own target environment.

## Utilize a Sample Application to generate Trace Data

Provided below is a link to EKS documentation for a sample workload that is configured to send trace data to your configured Collector. 

[Sample Application for Trace Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sample-app.html)

## Verify that Trace Data is being sent to X-Ray

* Open the [X-Ray console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home)
* Select “Traces” in the menu on the left
* See if your Trace data is there
