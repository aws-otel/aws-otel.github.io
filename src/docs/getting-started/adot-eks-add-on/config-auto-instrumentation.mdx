## OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation injection

The ADOT EKS Add-on can inject and configure OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries. To enable this feature, you have to
annotate your workload with:

```
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-<language>: true
```

Languages that support injection are: java, nodejs, python and dotnet.

The annotation can be added to a namespace, so that all pods within that namespace will get instrumentation, or by adding
the annotation to individual PodSpec objects, available as part of Deployment, Statefulset, and other resources.

Example:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment-with-multiple-containers
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-pod-with-multiple-containers
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-pod-with-multiple-containers
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myImage1
```

## Configuring the auto-instrumentation

The `Instrumentation` custom resource definition (CRD) can be used to select the auto-instrumentation version that will be injected into the workload. The `Instrumentation` CRD can also be used to configure auto-instrumentation agents. For more information on how to configure auto-instrumentation injection please refer to the [OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/tree/main#opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-injection).

In the `Instrumentation` CRD you can define the collector endpoint used to submit the telemetry data and the images used
for each language:

```
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: my-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: <endpoint>
  java:
    image: <image>
```

Bellow we can find an example with the `endpoint` and `image` fields populated:

```
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: my-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: http://adot-collector:4317
  java:
    image: public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/adot-autoinstrumentation-java:v1.28.0
```

In the example above, we are configuring the endpoint that will be used to submit the telemetry signals to `http://adot-collector:4317`. If the workload
already has the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment defined, that will be used instead. In the example
we are also configuring the version of the ADOT Java Agent that should be used to `public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/adot-autoinstrumentation-java:v1.28.0`.


For detailed information on the `Instrumentation` CRD  please refer to the [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/docs/api.md#instrumentation).
