In OpenTelemetry, a resource represents the source of telemetry signals, for example, a pod in Kubernetes that exposes 
Prometheus metrics. The Kubernetes attributes processor allows for the automatic setting of span and metric 
resource attributes with Kubernetes metadata. More information in OpenTelemetry resources can be found in the official 
documentation [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/glossary/#resource). 

# How the Kubernetes Attributes Processor works

A collector receiver is responsible for storing the  connection ip, the ip address in which the signal originated from, 
in the telemetry signals context for use by subsequent components. By default, if the connection ip is available, 
the Kubernetes attributes processor will attempt match the connection ip to a pods ip. If a match is made pod metadata 
is attached as resource attributes. Additional association rules can also be specified if the connection ip is not 
available. The Kubernetes attributes processor 
[README](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor) has more detailed
information on processor configuration options. 

# How can I leverage these new resource attributes?

After the Kubernetes attributes processor associates a data point with a Kubernetes pod it will automatically attach Kubernetes pod 
metadata as resource attributes. The default list of resource attributes populated can be found within the [Kubernetes attributes processor
module](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor/config.go). 
Additional resource attributes from a pre-defined list can be selected using the configuration. Knowing 
how to leverage these new resource attributes is entirely up to you. In the following two sections we will 
provide examples in which these resource attributes can be utilized to enhance your observability solution. 
First, we will introduce a scenario that will leverage the resource attributes in a subsequent collector 
processor. Second, we will present a few different places where Kubernetes resource attributes can be used after 
exporting out of the collector and into a backed of your choosing. 

## Gateway collector example

In the following example we have two applications that are instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs. 
One application will send telemetry signals directly to a gateway collector and the other is 
connected to a proxy. The proxy is responsible for forwarding the telemetry signals to the gateway. 
The gateway collector is a collector which receives all telemetry signals over a single OTLP endpoint 
before exporting them out of the cluster. The OpenTelemetry documentation provides more details about
the [gateway deployment pattern](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/gateway/). Telemetry 
signals not sent directly to the gateway collector must have Kubernetes resource attributes populated so that the 
Kubernetes attributes processor can perform associations. OpenTelemetry SDKs allows [configuration of resource 
attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/general-sdk-configuration/#otel_resource_attributes) 
through environment variables. The [Kubernetes downward api](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/) 
can be used to make metatadata fields available to the SDK environment variable.

This example scenario can support multiple telemetry sources as long as the data ends up at our 
single gateway collector. 

The following collector configuration would be used by the gateway ADOT collector. 

```yaml
extensions:
  sigv4auth:
    region: us-west-2
    service: "aps"

receivers:  
  otlp:
    grpc:
    http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: fake.amp.endpoint
    auth:
      authenticator: sigv4auth
  awsxray:

service:
  extensions: [sigv4auth]
  pipelines:   
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

The starting configuration does not do much. Metrics and traces are ingested using an OTLP receiver 
which are then exported to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) and AWS X-Ray respectively.

Our observability solution now has a new requirement. We need to drop all metric and traces which 
flow through or originate from a specific node. The first step to accomplish this is to ensure that 
all data points have the necessary resource attributes attached to them. To do this we will configure 
our Kubernetes attributes processor. During this step we also add the indexed_attributes field in the x-ray 
exporter. The indexed_attributes option ensures that the k8s.node.name resource attribute is searchable 
in AWS X-Ray.

```yaml
extensions:
  sigv4auth:
    region: us-west-2
    service: "aps"

receivers:  
  otlp:
    grpc:
    http:

processors:
  k8sattributes:
    pod_association:
      # for telemetry signals that may have came through a proxy
      - sources:
          - from: resource_attribute
            name: k8s.pod.uid
          - from: resource_attribute
            name: k8s.namespace.name
      # for telemetry signals that are sent directly to the gateway
      - sources:
          - from: connection
  batch:

exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: fake.amp.endpoint
    auth:
      authenticator: sigv4auth
  awsxray:
      indexed_attributes: [otel.resource.k8s.node.name]

service:
  extensions: [sigv4auth]
  pipelines:   
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [k8sattributes, batch]
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [k8sattributes, batch]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

After our Kubernetes attributes processor is configured we can then leverage additional processors that are 
available in the ADOT collector. To drop metrics we will utilize the filter processor and to sample 
out traces we will leverage the group by trace and tail sampling processor. The [advanced sampling documentation page](/docs/getting-started/advanced-sampling)
providers a deeper look into advanced sampling configurations. 

```yaml
extensions:
  sigv4auth:
    region: us-west-2
    service: "aps"

receivers:  
  otlp:
    grpc:
    http:

processors:
  k8sattributes:
    pod_association:
      - sources:
          - from: resource_attribute
            name: k8s.pod.uid
          - from: resource_attribute
            name: k8s.namespace.name
      - sources:
          - from: connection
  groupbytrace:
  tailsampling:
    policies:
      [
        {
          name: node-policy,
          type: string_attribute,
          string_attribute: {key: k8s.node.name, values: [badnode-1234]}
        }
      ]
  filter:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        resource_attributes:
          - key: k8s.node.name
            value: badnode-1234
  batch:

exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: fake.amp.endpoint
    resource_to_telemetry_conversion:
      enabled: true
    auth:
      authenticator: sigv4auth
  awsxray:
    indexed_attributes: [otel.resource.k8s.node.name]

service:
  extensions: [sigv4auth]
  pipelines:   
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [k8sattributes, filter, batch]
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [k8sattributes, groupbytrace, tailsampling, batch]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

Our final configuration is complete. While this example is very small and very specific the idea is 
to show you the different ways Kubernetes resource attributes processor can be used within a collector pipeline. 
Being able to reliably associate pod metadata with incoming telemetry signals can come in handy 
in many ways! Next, we will give you a few more ideas on where these resource attributes can be 
used outside of a collector. 

# Using Kubernetes resource attributes outside of a collector

Kubernetes resources are useful outside of the collector also. Below are 
some different places where these resource attributes can come in handy. Generally, 
resource attributes can assist you in narrowing down queries while troubleshooting 
or aggregating data across a specific set of Kubernetes resources. 

1. Visualize your Prometheus metrics in Amazon Managed Grafana. Use Grafana dashboards 
to query data based on Kubernetes resource attributes. Use the resource_to_telemetry_conversion 
configuration option to translate resource attributes to Prometheus labels. 
2. Use Kubernetes resource attributes to filter traces in X-Ray based on annotations values. 
The AWS X-Ray developer guides provides more information about filtering with [complex keywords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-filters.html#console-filters-complex). 
Use the `indexed_attributes` configuration option in the X-Ray exporter to ensure 
that the resource attributes are searchable.
3. If you leverage the AWS EMF exporter, enable [resource_to_telemetry_conversion](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awsemfexporter#resource-attributes-to-metric-labels) 
to make Kubernetes resource attributes available to the EMF Exporter. New dimension sets, dashboards, 
and alarms that can leverage Kubernetes resource attributes.
