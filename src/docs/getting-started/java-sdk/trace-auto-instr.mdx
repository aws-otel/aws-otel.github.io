title: 'Tracing with AWS Auto Instrumentation Agent'
description:
    Learn how to get started with Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent... This package includes the instrumentation agent,
    instrumentations for all supported libraries and all available data exporters, providing a complete out of the box
    experience for tracing on AWS. The agent is preconfigured to generate trace IDs compatible with AWS X-Ray, which
    will also work with any other tracing system, and enables trace propagation using W3C Trace Context, B3, and X-Ray.

The Auto-Instrumentation Java Agent for OpenTelemetry can be attached to any Java 8+ application to gather telemetry data from a diverse
set of libraries and frameworks. This data can also be exported to different backends in different formats. In addittion,
the agent can be configured with environment variables or CLI parameters.

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to use the java agent for automatic trace instrumentation.

## Requirements

[Java 8 (or later)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry.Getting the auto-instrumentation agent

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar).

If you'd prefer to pin to a specific version, check out our [releases](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases).

This package includes the instrumentation agent and instrumentation for all supported libraries and all available data exporters,
providing a complete out-of-the-box experience for tracing. The agent is preconfigured to generate trace IDs compatible
with [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/), which works with any other tracing system, and enables trace propagation
using [W3C Trace Context](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/), [B3](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation),
and [X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader).

Note: You’ll also need to have the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Running the agent from the command line
To run your app with the agent, specify the `-javaagent` flag when starting up your application,
pointing to the downloaded agent Java Archive (JAR) artifact. In addition, while not required by the agent itself,
almost all tracing systems require a service name and service namespace defined to identify your application, which you can specify
with the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable and `service.name` / `service.namespace` attribute keys.
```
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=MyApp,service.namespace=MyTeam java -javaagent:path/to/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar -jar myapp.jar
```
**Note:** Like normal system properties, the `-javaagent` flag must come before -jar or your main class name.

The above command will start up your app with the agent activated, and instrumentation is then activated
automatically. For many cases, this is all you need to use tracing.

## Running the agent in Docker
If your app is packaged in Docker, the easiest way to run with the agent is to use the
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable, which automatically sets flags for java. Adding this
snippet to your `Dockerfile` will typically be enough to enable tracing, although if you already set
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, don't forget to make sure to add to your existing setting rather than replacing it.

```
ADD https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar /opt/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar
ENV JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-javaagent:/opt/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar
```

## Advanced configuration of the auto-instrumentation agent
By default OpenTelemetry Java agent uses the [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/master/exporters/otlp)
and is configured to send data to a [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md)
at `localhost:4317`.

The agent can be configured using [standard OpenTelemetry options for configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation#configuration-parameters-subject-to-change).
For example, to set the random sampling rate for creating traces, you can set either the `-Dotel.config.sampler.probability`
Java system property or `OTEL_CONFIG_SAMPLER_PROBABILITY` environment variable to a value between 0 and 1 with the sampling rate,
meaning to specify a sampling rate of 30%, you can set the environment variable `OTEL_CONFIG_SAMPLER_PROBABILITY=0.3`.

## Instrumenting within your application
While the Java agent provides automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks, you might find the need
to perform instrumentation in your application, for example, to provide custom data or to instrument
code within the application itself.

### Adding custom attributes
You can add custom attributes to a `Span` by defining an `AttributeKey` and calling `setAttribute` on the current `Span`.
```java lineNumbers=true
@Controller
public class AppController {

  private static final AttributeKey<String> ORGANIZATION_ID = AttributeKeys.stringKey("organization.id");

  @GetMapping("/")
  @ResponseBody
  public String handler() {
     String organizationId = findOrganizationIdForCurrentUser();
     TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan().setAttribute(ORGANIZATION_ID, organizationId);
  }
}
```
In this example, the Java agent has already created a span corresponding to the Spring
handler method. You use `TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan()` to access that span and set the
attribute for a key that you have defined as a constant by using `AttributeKeys`.

**Note:** When using AWS X-Ray as your tracing backend, you can control whether attributes are uploaded as annotations
or metadata by configuring the AWS OTel Collector’s
[indexed keys](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration).
By default, all attributes will be metadata.

### Creating spans
To add a span corresponding to a method in your application, we recommend using the `@WithSpan` annotation.
```java lineNumbers=true
import io.opentelemetry.extensions.auto.annotations.WithSpan;

public class MyClass {
  @WithSpan
  public void MyLogic() {
      // Span created encapsulating the logic
  }
}
```
This automatically creates a span corresponding to the method with the same name as the method. You
can use `TracingContextUtils.getCurrentSpan()` inside the method to customize it, for example by
adding attributes.

You can also use the [Tracer API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/master/QUICKSTART.md#tracing)
if you need more functionality or want to trace only a block, rather than a method, of code.

### Using the AWS SDK
The Java agent includes instrumentation for the AWS SDK, which is enabled by default. This means you don’t need to
complete any additional steps for detailed tracing of the AWS SDK.
