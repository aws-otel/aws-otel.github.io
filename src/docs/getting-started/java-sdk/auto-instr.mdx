title: 'Auto-Instrumentation for Traces and Metrics with the Java agent'
description:
    Learn how to get started with Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent. This package includes the instrumentation agent,
    instrumentations for all supported libraries and all available data exporters, providing a complete out of the box
    experience for tracing and metrics on AWS. The agent is preconfigured to generate trace IDs compatible with AWS X-Ray, which
    will also work with any other tracing system, and enables trace propagation using W3C Trace Context, B3, and X-Ray.

## Introduction

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent can be attached to any Java 8+ application to gather
telemetry data from a diverse set of libraries and frameworks. The agent will automatically transform code at startup
to collect tracing data. It is preconfigured for compatibility with X-Ray and AWS services but can also be used with any
other tracing backend. Out of the box, it propagates traces using all of W3C Trace Context, B3, and X-Amzn-Trace-Id.

## Requirements

[Java 8 (or later)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry.

Note: You’ll also need to have the [ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Installation

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar).

If you'd prefer to pin to a specific version, check out our [releases](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases).

The ADOT Java Agent is also published in the following maven coordinates:

```kotlin lineNumbers=true
dependencies {
    implementation("software.amazon.opentelemetry:aws-opentelemetry-agent:2.11.5")
}
```

```xml lineNumbers=true
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.opentelemetry</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-opentelemetry-agent</artifactId>
      <version>2.11.5</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Running an Application with Auto-Instrumentation
To run your app with the agent, specify the `-javaagent` flag when starting up your application,
pointing to the downloaded agent Java Archive (JAR) artifact. In addition, while not required by the agent itself,
almost all tracing systems require a service name and service namespace defined to identify your application, which you can specify
with the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable and `service.name` / `service.namespace` attribute keys.
```
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=MyApp,service.namespace=MyTeam java -javaagent:path/to/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar -jar myapp.jar
```
**Note:** Like normal system properties, the `-javaagent` flag must come before -jar or your main class name.

The above command will start up your app with the agent activated, and instrumentation is then activated
automatically. For many cases, this is all you need to use tracing.

### Configuring Auto-Instrumentation

**Note:** Skip this part if you are onboarding with CloudWatch Application Signals.

By default OpenTelemetry Java agent uses the [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/master/exporters/otlp)
and is configured to send data to a [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md)
at `http://localhost:4317` for both metrics and traces.

The agent can be configured using [standard OpenTelemetry options for configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md) using either environment variables or system properties.
For example, to set the random sampling rate for creating traces, you can set the environment variables
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio` and `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.3` to configure a sampling rate of 30%.

Another useful configuration that can be used during development is to log traces and metrics. This can be achieved by
setting `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=logging` and `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=logging`.

### Using CloudWatch Application Signals

You can use CloudWatch Application Signals to automatically instrument your applications on AWS using ADOT Java auto-instrumentation so that you can monitor current application health and track long-term application performance against your business objectives. Application Signals provides you with a unified, application-centric view of your applications, services, and dependencies, and helps you monitor and triage application health.

[Get started with CloudWatch Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Monitoring-Sections.html)

### Using X-Ray Remote Sampling

The ADOT Java Auto-Instrumentation can be configured to use [X-Ray remote sampling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html)
by setting the environment variable `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=xray`. You will also need to [configure the OpenTelemetry collector](/docs/getting-started/remote-sampling)
to allow the application to fetch sampling configuration. 

You can further configure the Sampler by setting the `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` environment variable. You can update the endpoint and the polling rate as follows:
```
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=endpoint=<ENDPOINT>,polling_interval=<INTERVAL_IN_SECS>
``` 

By default the sampler sends requests to `http://localhost:2000` and has a polling rate of `300 seconds`. By setting `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` 
environment variable you can change the endpoint the sampler talks with when getting sampling configuration from AWS X-Ray Console. For example setting 
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=endpoint=http://localhost:4000,polling_interval=60` would configure the sampler to communicate with `http://localhost:4000` and poll the sampling rules every `60 seconds`.

### Running the agent in Docker

If your application is packaged in Docker, the easiest way to run with the agent is to use the
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable, which automatically sets flags for Java. Adding this
snippet to your `Dockerfile` will typically be enough to enable tracing, although if you already set
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, don't forget to make sure to add to your existing setting rather than replacing it.

```
ADD https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar /opt/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar
ENV JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-javaagent:/opt/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar
```

## Using Manual Instrumentation

While the Java agent provides automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks, you might find the need
to perform instrumentation in your application, for example, to provide custom data or to instrument
code within the application itself.

To perform manual instrumentation alongside the agent, you only need to use the `opentelemetry-api` aritfact. The
version of this artifact can not be newer than the version of the agent. Notably, you do not need the `opentelemetry-sdk`
artifact, any usage of it will be disabled by the agent.

##### For Gradle:
```kotlin lineNumbers=true
dependencies {
    implementation("io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api:1.32.0")
}
```

##### For Maven:
```xml lineNumbers=true
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.32.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

See the [document on manual instrumentation](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/manual-instr)
for more detail on using the OpenTelemetry API.
