description:
    Learn how to get started with Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent... This package includes the instrumentation agent,
    instrumentations for all supported libraries and all available data exporters, providing a complete out of the box
    experience for tracing on AWS. The agent is preconfigured to generate trace IDs compatible with AWS X-Ray, which
    will also work with any other tracing system, and enables trace propagation using W3C Trace Context, B3, and X-Ray.

The Java library for OpenTelemetry can be attached to any Java 8+ application to gather telemetry data from a diverse
set of libraries and frameworks.

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to use OpenTelemetry Java SDK for traces instrumentation in the application.

<SectionSeparator />

## Requirements

[Java 8 (or later)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry.Getting the auto-instrumentation agent

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar).

If you'd prefer to pin to a specific version, check out our [releases](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases).

This package includes the instrumentation agent and instrumentation for all supported libraries and all available data exporters,
providing a complete out-of-the-box experience for tracing. The agent is preconfigured to generate trace IDs compatible
with [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/), which works with any other tracing system, and enables trace propagation
using [W3C Trace Context](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/), [B3](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation),
and [X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader).

Note: You’ll also need to have the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector running to export traces to X-Ray.
See the <Link to="/docs/getting-started/collector">AWS OTel Collector documentation</Link> for setup instructions.

## Instrumenting an application without the agent
You might not be able to or want to run the Java agent with your application. For instance, because the Java agent
rewrites parts of the application at startup time, it could have a negative impact on startup performance. Instead of
using the agent, you can modify your app to include and initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK and library instrumentation manually.

First, include the OpenTelemetry SDK as a compile dependency.

##### For Gradle:
```java lineNumbers=true
dependencies {
    implementation('io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk:0.8.0')
}
```

##### For Maven:
```xml lineNumbers=true
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-api</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Next, you’ll need to initialize an exporter to send traces too.

If you’re using Spring Boot, you can use the
[OTLP starter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/master/instrumentation/spring/starters/otlp-exporter-starter)
to set up the exporter. This also sets up tracing of requests for Spring Web MVC and Spring WebFlux. To have Spring Boot
automatically initialize tracing, add a dependency on the starter.

##### For Gradle:
```java
implementation 'io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-otlp-exporter-starter:0.8.0'
```

##### For Maven:
```xml lineNumbers=true
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-otlp-exporter-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you’re not using Spring Boot, then as early as possible in your application, generally as a static block in your
main class, or early in the main method, register the OTLP exporter like this.

```java lineNumbers=true
OpenTelemetrySdk.getTracerProvider()
  .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.newBuilder(
    OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.newBuilder()
      .readSystemProperties()
      .readEnvironmentVariables()
      .build())
.build());
```

This initializes the OTLP span exporter with default settings read from system properties or environment variables.
You can read about the configuration options for the exporter on the
[Open Telemetry Java Instumentation GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation#otlp-exporter).

To actually instrument your code, we recommend you use library instrumentation when available. These offer simple entry points
to automatically generate spans for a given library without having to manually create them. For example, to instrument calls using
the AWS SDK, add a dependency on the library instrumentation for the AWS SDK.

##### For Gradle:
```java
implementation 'io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-aws-sdk-2.2:0.8.0'
```

##### For Maven:
```xml lineNumbers=true
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-aws-sdk-2.2</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

And when initializing an AWS SDK, add the `TracingExecutionInterceptor`.

```java lineNumbers=true
DynamoDbClient.builder()
  .overrideConfiguration(ClientOverrideConfiguration.builder()
    .addExecutionInterceptor(AwsSdk.newInterceptor())
    .build())
  .build();
```

This will enable tracing for all DynamoDb calls using this client.
