[CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) collect, aggregate, 
and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Data are collected as as performance log events 
using [embedded metric format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html). 
These performance log events are entries that use a structured JSON schema that enables high-cardinality data to be ingested and stored at scale. 
Amazon CloudWatch can create the aggregated CloudWatch metrics at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level from the received EMF data. 

CloudWatch Container Insights has been supported by ECS Agent and CloudWatch Agent to collect infrastructure metrics for many resources such as
such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. To migrate existing customers to use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, we are currently enhancing the 
AWS OTel Collector to support the same CloudWatch Container Insights experience for the following platforms:  
  * Amazon ECS 
  * Amazon EKS
  * Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2

For Amazon ECS, the cluster and service level metrics are already supported ([see the public AWS doc for details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-ECS-adot.html))
and the support for instance level metrics is working in progress. For Amazon EKS and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon on EC2, all the infrastructure metrics are supported. 
In this tutorial, we will walk through how to enable CloudWatch Container Insights with AWS OTel Collector for an EKS EC2 cluster.

## Getting Started
To use AWS OTel Collector to collect infrastructure metrics for a service cluster, we need to make sure [all the prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-prerequisites.html) are satisfied.

Then we can deploy AWS OTel Collector as a daemon set to the cluster by entering the following command:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/main/deployment-template/eks/otel-container-insight-infra.yaml |
sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/MyCluster/;s/{{region_name}}/region/" |
kubectl apply -f -
```
Replace `MyCluster` with the name of the cluster and `region` with the name of the AWS Region of the cluster. You can run the following command
to confirm the AWS OTel Collector is running:
```
kubectl get pods -l name=aws-otel-eks-ci -n aws-otel-eks
```
If the results include multiple pods (one for each cluster node) in the Running state, the collector is running and collecting metrics from the cluster.
The AWS OTel Collector creates a log group named `/aws/containerinsights/MyCluster/performance` and sends the performance log events to this log group.
Each collector pod on a cluster node will publish logs to a log stream with the name of the cluster node. In the screenshot, three log streams are present
under the log group `/aws/containerinsights/ci-demo/performance` and each corresponds to one cluster node:

The metrics that Container Insights collects are also available in CloudWatch automatic dashboards as different resource types, such as 
`EKS Clusters`, `EKS Namespaces`, `EKS Nodes`, `EKS Services`, and `EKS Pods`. Here is a screenshot for the pod level metrics for 
a cluster named `ci-demo`:

## Configurations to support CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS EC2
The yaml file used in previous deployment contains the default configuration for AWS OTel Collector to enables CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS. The default
configuration includes the essential components for collecting infrastructure metric in EKS cluster.

### Receiver
The receiver `awscontainerinsightreceiver` is a component introduced for Container Insights support. It collects metrics from an embedded `cadvisor` lib and 
kubernetes api server. The default metric collection interval is 60 second. 

### Processor
The processor `awscontainerinsightprocessor` is also a component introduced for ContainerInsights support. Its main purpose is to decorate the metrics 
collected by the receiver `awscontainerinsightreceiver`. Based on certain rules, it adds different resource attributes to different metrics. 
The processor `batch/metrics` is used to batch the metrics before sending them to aws emf exporter. This reduces the number of requests that the 
exporter needs to publish the metrics.

### Exporter
The exporter `awsemf` is used to sent the metrics to CloudWatch Backend in the form of EMF logs. In the configuration for `awsemf` exporter, the two 
placeholders `{ClusterName}` and `{NodeName}` in the log group and stream names will be replaced dynamically with the names of the cluster 
and the node on which the AWS OTel Collector is running. In the `metric_declarations` section, different types of exported metrics are specified. The current setting 
supports the automatic dashboards for Container Insights. Customers can add new entries in `metric_declarations` section to export other metrics,
or change the `dimensions` to generate different set of metrics using the same `metric_name_selectors`.
