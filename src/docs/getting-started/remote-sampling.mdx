## Enable awsproxy extension

Enable the extension by adding this snippet to your collector configuration.

```yaml
extensions:
  awsproxy:
service:
  extensions: [awsproxy]
```

For example, a full configuration that receives spans as OTLP, exports to X-Ray, and enables remote sampling may
look like this.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
exporters:
  awsxray:
extensions:
  awsproxy:
service:
  extensions: [awsproxy]
  pipeline:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

This enables the proxy listening on the default endpoint of `0.0.0.0:2000` - SDK sampling extensions for X-Ray remote
sampling connect to `localhost:2000` by default and will work out of the box when deploying the collector as a sidecar.

The full list of configuration options can be found in the [component documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/awsproxy).

Once you have enabled the proxy extension and configured the remote sampler in your application, you can follow the [AWS X-Ray documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html) to define custom sampling rules for incoming requests and see them applied across your entire fleet.

The IAM policy used with the collector also needs permission to fetch sampling rules. This policy would allow the collector
to export trace data and fetch sampling rules.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:PutTraceSegments",
                "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Warning: The proxy extension allows any application with network connectivity to the collector to send requests to X-Ray
without authentication. If not using any other authentication mechanism in front of the collector, it is recommended to
configure network policy to only allow network connectivity to applications that should be allowed to access X-Ray with
the above IAM permissions, for example using network firewall rules.**

## Remote Sampling Implementation specific Caveats

Below mentioned table displays X-Ray sampling attributes and X-Ray equivalent OTel sampling attributes used by the OTel remote sampling implementation. Here's how you can [configure X-Ray sampling attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html#xray-console-config) in AWS X-Ray Console. Below mentioned caveats to keep in mind when using OTel remote sampling implementation.

1. Some of the X-Ray equivalent OTel sampling fields are instrumentation specific like `HTTP_TARGET`, `HTTP_URL`, `HTTP_METHOD` and `HTTP_HOST`. If instrumentation you're using in your application won't set them then remote sampling implementation would not have all these fields to match against in that case it would only use available fields like `SERVICE_NAME` and `CLOUD_PLATFORM`
2. Sampling implementation would match `URLPath` (X-Ray sampling attribute set on AWS X-Ray Console) with `HTTP_TARGET` as well as `HTTP_URL` and if it finds a match with one of them it would consider matched

|X-Ray Sampling Attributes | X-Ray equivalent OTel Sampling Semantic Attributes |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ServiceName <br/> ServiceType <br/> URLPath <br/> Host <br/> HTTPMethod <br/>  Attributes <br/> | ResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME <br/> ResourceAttributes.CLOUD_PLATFORM <br/> SemanticAttributes.HTTP_TARGET/SemanticAttributes.HTTP_URL <br/> SemanticAttributes.HTTP_HOST <br/> SemanticAttributes.HTTP_METHOD <br/>  Attributes <br/>|
