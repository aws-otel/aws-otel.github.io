[AWS X-Ray remote sampling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html) is supported
with OpenTelemetry by configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector to proxy sampling requests to AWS X-Ray using the
`awsproxy` extension. Enable the extension by adding this snippet to your collector configuration.

```yaml
extensions:
  awsproxy:
```

For example, a full configuration that receives spans as OTLP, exports to X-Ray, and enables remote sampling may
look like this.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
exporters:
  awsxray:
extensions:
  awsproxy:
service:
  pipeline:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [awsxray]
```

This enables the proxy listening on the default endpoint of `0.0.0.0:2000` - SDK sampling extensions for X-Ray remote
sampling connect to `localhost:2000` by default and will work out of the box when deploying the collector as a sidecar.

The IAM policy used with the collector also needs permission to fetch sampling rules. This policy would allow the collector
to export trace data and fetch sampling rules.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:PutTraceSegments",
                "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Warning: The proxy extension allows any application with network connectivity to the collector to send requests to X-Ray
without authentication. If not using any other authentication mechanism in front of the collector, it is recommended to
configure network policy to only allow network connectivity to applications that should be allowed to access X-Ray with
the above IAM permissions, for example using network firewall rules.**
