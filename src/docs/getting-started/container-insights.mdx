title: 'Using CloudWatch Container Insights with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry'
description:
    CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices.
    Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS),
    Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2.
    Amazon ECS support includes support for Fargate. Prometheus metrics with pre-built CloudWatch dashboards are also supported on these platforms.

[CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) collects, aggregates,
and summarizes metrics from your containerized applications and microservices.
Data is collected as log events using [embedded metric format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html).
These log events are entries that use a structured JSON schema that enables high-cardinality data to be ingested and stored at scale.
Amazon CloudWatch can create the aggregated CloudWatch metrics from the received EMF data.

CloudWatch Container Insights uses the [CloudWatch agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent) to collect
both [infrastructure metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html)
and [Prometheus metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus.html).
To migrate existing customers to use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry,
we have enhanced the [ADOT Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) to support the same CloudWatch Container Insights experience.

## Collecting infrastructure metrics

<!-- NOTE: The `-` list syntax didn't work when item is Link -->
<!-- TODO: link to other ecs, eks doc when they are merged it -->

CloudWatch Container Insights collects metrics for many resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.
It also provides diagnostic information such as container restart failures.
The metrics are aggregated at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level as CloudWatch metrics.

The following platforms are supported:

- <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/eks-infra">Amazon EKS and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2</Link>
- <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/eks-fargate">Amazon EKS and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon Fargate</Link>
- [Amazon ECS with cluster- and service-level metrics](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/components/ecs-metrics-receiver)
- Amazon ECS on Amazon EC2 with instance-level metrics (upcoming)

## Collecting Prometheus metrics

CloudWatch Container Insights monitoring for Prometheus automates the discovery of Prometheus metrics from containerized systems and workloads.
To collect the Prometheus metrics, the ADOT Collector uses [ECSObserver extension](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver),
Prometheus Receiver and the  [CloudWatch embedded metric format Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awsemfexporter).

The following platforms are supported:

- <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/eks-prometheus">Amazon EKS and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2</Link>
- <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/eks-fargate">Amazon EKS and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon Fargate</Link>
- <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/ecs-prometheus">Amazon ECS on Amazon EC2 and Fargate</Link>

### Pre-built dashboards for workloads with Prometheus metrics

CloudWatch console has auto dashboard for workloads listed in following table.

| Environment           | AWS App Mesh | Java JMX | NGINX | NGINX Plus | HAProxy | Memcached |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------|-------|------------|---------|-----------|
| <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/eks-prometheus">EKS</Link> | Y            | Y        | Y     | N          | Y       | Y         |
| <Link to="/docs/getting-started/container-insights/ecs-prometheus">ECS</Link> | Y            | Y        | Y     | Y          | N       | N         |

Workload without pre-build dashboard can still send metrics to CloudWatch. However, you need to [build your CloudWatch dashboard manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_dashboard.html).

### Export Prometheus metrics format

Prometheus metrics in Container Insights are exported as both logs and metrics.
The embedded metric format exporter matches metrics based on the `metrics_declaration` configuration to add extra metadata in structured logs.
CloudWatch extracts embedded metric format log data to metrics automatically.
For example assume that you have an EKS cluster called `eks-1` and a ECS cluster called `ecs-1`.
You will see the following resources in the CloudWatch console. The names of the log groups contain the cluster name. In CloudWatch,
all clusters are saved in one metric namespace, with different dimension values used to differentiate metrics from different clusters.

| Environment           | Log group                                     | Metrics Namespace                  |
