[CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) collect, aggregate,
and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Data are collected as performance log events
using [embedded metric format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html).
These performance log events are entries that use a structured JSON schema that enables high-cardinality data to be ingested and stored at scale.
Amazon CloudWatch can create the aggregated CloudWatch metrics at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level from the received EMF data.

CloudWatch Container Insights also [support Prometheus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus.html)
with pre-built dashboards on ECS and EKS.
