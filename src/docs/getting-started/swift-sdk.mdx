The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Swift refers to some components developed to complement the upstream [OpenTelemetry (OTel) Swift SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift). Below are links to guides that go over how to configure the relevant components of OpenTelemetry to send trace and events data to the AWS Real User Monitoring (RUM) backend.
