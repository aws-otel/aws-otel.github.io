# Getting Started with the Ruby SDK on Traces Instrumentation

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Ruby refers to some components developed to complement the upstream [OpenTelemetry (OTel) Ruby SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/tree/main/sdk). Below are links to guides that go over how to configure the relevant components of the OpenTelemetry SDK to send trace data to the AWS X-Ray backend.
