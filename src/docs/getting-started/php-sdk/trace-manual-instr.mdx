## Introduction

This guide covers the components of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) PHP, and describes how to configure the relevant ADOT components to send trace data to the AWS X-Ray backend. 

Link to [OpenTelemetry Developer Guide - PHP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/php/)

<SectionSeparator />

## Requirements

[PHP 7.4 or later](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry

Note: You’ll also need to have the [ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

<SectionSeparator />

## Installation

In order to send traces from your application, the following OpenTelemetry PHP packages must be installed in your application’s root directory


* [X-Ray ID Generator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib/tree/main/src/Aws/Xray)
* [X-Ray propagator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib/tree/main/src/Aws/Xray)

```bash
 composer require open-telemetry/contrib-aws
```

* [OpenTelemetry API for tracing](https://packagist.org/packages/open-telemetry/api)

```bash
composer require open-telemetry/api
```

* [OpenTelemetry SDK for tracing](https://packagist.org/packages/open-telemetry/sdk)

```bash
composer require open-telemetry/sdk
```


* [OTLP GRPC exporter](https://packagist.org/packages/open-telemetry/exporter-otlp-grpc)

In order to use this package, you must also install the GRPC package using PECL. See the instructions on the [OpenTelemetry PHP repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php#optional-dependencies) for more information.

```bash
composer require open-telemetry/exporter-otlp-grpc
```

## Setting up the Global Tracer

### Sending Traces to AWS X-Ray

In order to send trace data to AWS X-Ray,  instantiate a new tracer provider and provide it with the X-Ray ID generator, X-Ray propagator, and OTLP exporter pointing to the collector's address.

```å
// Initialize Span Processor, X-Ray ID generator, Tracer Provider, and Propagator

$spanProcessor = new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPExporter());
$idGenerator = new IdGenerator();
$tracerProvider = new TracerProvider($spanProcessor, null, null, null, $idGenerator);
$propagator = new Propagator();
$tracer = $tracerProvider->getTracer('io.opentelemetry.contrib.php');
```

### Using the AWS resource detectors

The[AWS resource detectors](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/adding-aws-x-ray-support-to-the-opentelemetry-php-library/)are included with the X-Ray ID generator and X-Ray propagator in the `open-telemetry/contrib-aws` package. 

The ADOT PHP SDK supports automatically recording metadata in EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, and EKS environments.


```å
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp \Psr7\HttpFactory;
use OpenTelemetry\Aws\Ec2\Detector;      
        
$client = new Client(['base_uri' **=>** '/ec2/endpoint']);
$requestFactory = new HttpFactory();

$detector = new Detector($client, $requestFactory);

print_r(`$detector->getResource()->getAttributes()`)
```


To see what attributes are captured and how to add other resource detectors, see the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib/tree/main/src/Aws).

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for the OpenTelemetry SDK, set the DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL environment variable as follows:

```
use Psr\Log\LogLevel;
 
public const DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL =LogLevel::DEBUG;
```

<SubSectionSeparator />

## Instrumenting an Application

**Warning: Some instrumentations are not yet stable and the attributes they collect are subject to change until the instrumentation reaches 1.0 stability. It is recommended that you pin a specific version of an instrumentation**

When you instrument a library, every time the library is used, the request is automatically wrapped with a populated span.



### Instrumenting the AWS SDK

Run the following command to import the AWS SDK Instrumentation:


```
composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib:0.0.15
```


Import the `AwsSdkInstrumentation`  class in your PHP source code to activate the SDK instrumentation:


```
use OpenTelemetry\Instrumentation\AwsSdk\AwsSdkInstrumentation;
```


Tracing support for downstream AWS SDK calls to Amazon DynamoDB, S3, and others is provided by the [OpenTelemetry PHP AWS SDK Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib/tree/main/src/Instrumentation/AwsSdk).  The example below demonstrates setting up the AWS SDK instrumentation and tracing a call to S3. 


```
use OpenTelemetry\Instrumentation\AwsSdk\AwsSdkInstrumentation;

// Initialize Span Processor, X-Ray ID generator, Tracer Provider, and Propagator
$spanProcessor = new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPExporter());
$xrayIdGenerator = new IdGenerator();
$tracerProvider = new TracerProvider($spanProcessor, null, null, null, $xrayIdGenerator);
$xrayPropagator = new Propagator();

// Create new instance of AWS SDK Instrumentation class
$awssdkinstrumentation = new  AwsSdkInstrumentation();

// Configure AWS SDK Instrumentation with Propagator and set Tracer Provider (created above)
$awssdkinstrumentation->setPropagator($xrayPropagator);
$awssdkinstrumentation->setTracerProvider($tracerProvider);

// Create and activate root span
$root = $awssdkinstrumentation->getTracer()->spanBuilder('AwsSDKInstrumentation')->setSpanKind(SpanKind::KIND_SERVER)->startSpan();
$rootScope = $root->activate();

// Initialize all AWS Client instances
$s3Client = new S3Client([
    'region' => 'us-west-2',
]);

// Pass client instances to AWS SDK
$awssdkinstrumentation->instrumentClients([$s3Client]);

// Activate Instrumentation -- all AWS Client calls will be automatically instrumented
$awssdkinstrumentation->activate();

// Make S3 client call
$result = $s3Client->listBuckets();

// End the root span after all the calls to the AWS SDK have been made
$root->end();
$rootScope->detach();
```

## Custom Instrumentation

### Creating Custom Spans

Use custom spans to monitor the performance of internal activities that are not captured by instrumentation libraries. Note that only spans of kind `Server` are converted into X-Ray segments. All other spans are converted into X-Ray subsegments. For more on segments and subsegments, see the [AWS X-Ray developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-segments).


```
// this span will be translated to a segment in X-Ray backend`
$span = $awssdkinstrumentation->getTracer()->spanBuilder('segment')->setSpanKind(SpanKind::KIND_SERVER)->startSpan();

// this span will be translated to a subsegment in X-Ray backend
$span2 = $awssdkinstrumentation->getTracer()->spanBuilder('subsegment')->setSpanKind(SpanKind::KIND_CLIENT)->startSpan();
```



### Adding custom attributes

You can also add custom key-value pairs as attributes to your spans. Attributes are converted to metadata by default. If you [configure your collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/7bf2266a025425993a233f66c77a0810ab11a78b/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration), you can convert some or all of the attributes to annotations. To read more about X-Ray annotations and metadata see the [AWS X-Ray Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-annotations).


```
$span = $tracer
        ->spanBuilder('span')
        ->startSpan();
        
$spanScope = $root->activate();
        
$span->setAttributes(["a" => "1"]);
        
$span->end();
$spanScope->detach();
```
