AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry .NET SDK is a distribution of [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet),
configured to trace applications in a format that is compatible with the AWS X-Ray service.
This enables all the features of the OpenTelemetry project and configures its components to create traces that can be viewed in the AWS X-Ray console and allow propagation of those contexts across multiple downstream AWS services.

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to manually instrument your application step-by-step using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry .NET SDK.

## Getting Started

In order to instrument your .NET application for tracing, start by downloading the `OpenTelemetry` nuget package to your application.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
```

This is the OpenTelemetry SDK for .NET. The SDK deals with concerns such as sampling, processing pipeline, exporting telemetry to a particular backend etc.
This generally requires additional packages to be downloaded for specific instrumentation or exporter.

## Sending Traces to AWS X-Ray

By default, the OpenTelemetry SDK generates traces with W3C random ID which X-Ray backend doesn’t currently support yet.
You need to install the `OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay` to be able to use the `AWSXRayIdGenerator` which generates X-Ray compatible trace IDs.
If you plan to call another application instrumented with AWS X-Ray SDK, you’ll need to configure the `AWSXRayPropagator` as well.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay
```

**Note**: You’ll also need to have the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Instrumenting .NET Applications

### ASP.NET Core

Start by downloading the ASP.NET Core and OTLP exporter instrumentation
packages

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol
```

Next, in your application’s **Startup.cs** file, add the instrumentation and the OTLP exporter as services in the `ConfigureServices` method.
Make sure to call `AddXRayTraceId()` in the **beginning** when building `TracerProviderBuilder`. If you want to trace AWS SDK calls, make sure to configure `AWSXRayPropagator`.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Trace;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing((builder) => builder
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter());          
}
```

By default the OTLP exporter sends data to an OpenTelemetry collector at **localhost:4317**.

### ASP.NET

Download the ASP.NET and OTLP exporter instrumentation packages

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNet
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol
```

The ASP.NET instrumentation requires [modification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/master/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNet/README.md#step-2-modify-webconfig)
to **Web.config** to add a module to your web server. When installing `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNet` nuget package, the `TelemetryCorrelationHttpModule` should be automatically added.

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <modules>
    <add name="TelemetryCorrelationHttpModule"
    type="Microsoft.AspNet.TelemetryCorrelation.TelemetryCorrelationHttpModule,
    Microsoft.AspNet.TelemetryCorrelation"
    preCondition="integratedMode,managedHandler" />
    </modules>
</system.webServer>
```

Now all you need to do is enable the instrumentation for the application startup. This is done in the **Global.asax.cs** as shown below. Make sure to call `AddXRayTraceId()` in the **beginning** when building `TracerProviderBuilder`.
If you want to trace AWS SDK calls, make sure to configure `AWSXRayPropagator`.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Trace;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

public class WebApiApplication : HttpApplication
{
    private TracerProvider tracerProvider;
    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        this.tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
            .AddAspNetInstrumentation()
            .AddOtlpExporter()
            .Build();
    }
    
    protected void Application_End()
    {
        this.tracerProvider?.Dispose();
    }
}
```

### Console

Make sure to call `AddXRayTraceIdWithSampler()` in the **beginning** when building `TracerProviderBuilder`. You’ll need to pass the sampler you’re using in your application.
If you’re using the default sampler, just pass `new ParentBasedSampler(new AlwaysOnSampler())`. If you want to trace AWS SDK calls, make sure to configure `AWSXRayPropagator`.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Trace;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
        .AddXRayTraceIdWithSampler(your_sampler) // for generating AWS X-Ray compliant trace IDs
        .AddOtlpExporter()
        .Build();
```

### AWS SDK Instrumentation

For tracing downstream call to AWS services from your .NET application, you will need three components: the AWS X-Ray id generator, AWS X-Ray propagator, and AWS client instrumentation. 

Download the `OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Instrumentation.AWS` package:

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Instrumentation.AWS
```

Add AWS client instrumentation to your application. The below example is for an ASP.NET Core application.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Trace;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing((builder) => builder
        .AddAWSInstrumentation() // for tracing calls to AWS services via AWS SDK for .NET
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter());   
    
}
```
