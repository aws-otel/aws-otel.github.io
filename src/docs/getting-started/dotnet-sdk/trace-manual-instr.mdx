The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry .NET SDK contains an extension library for using OpenTelemetry with AWS X-Ray and for instrumenting the AWS SDK. In this tutorial, we will introduce how to manually instrument your application step-by-step using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry .NET SDK.

<SectionSeparator />

## Requirements

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry .NET SDK is compatible for .NET framework (net452 and above) and .NET Core (netstandard2.0 and above).

**Note**: You’ll also need to have the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Installation

In order to instrument your .NET application for tracing, start by downloading the `OpenTelemetry` nuget package to your application.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
```

The OpenTelemetry SDK for .NET deals with concerns such as sampling, a processing pipeline, and exporting telemetry to a particular backend.
This generally requires additional packages to be downloaded for specific instrumentation or exporter.

The OpenTelemetry SDK generates traces with W3C random ID which X-Ray backend doesn’t currently support.
You need to install the `OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay` to be able to use the `AWSXRayIdGenerator` which generates X-Ray compatible trace IDs.
If you plan to call another application instrumented with AWS X-Ray SDK, you’ll need to configure the `AWSXRayPropagator` as well.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay
```

In order to export traces from your application to ADOT Collector, you need to install `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol`.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol
```

By default the OpenTelemetry exporter sends data to an OpenTelemetry collector at `localhost:4317`.

## Setting up the Global Tracer

### Sending Traces to AWS X-Ray

Configure AWS X-Ray ID generator, propagator and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporter globally in your application as follows. Make sure to call `AddXRayTraceId()` in the very **beginning** when creating `TracerProvider`

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Trace;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
                        .AddXRayTraceId() // for generating AWS X-Ray compliant trace IDs
                        .AddOtlpExporter() // default address localhost:4317
                        .Build();

Sdk.SetDefaultTextMapPropagator(new AWSXRayPropagator()); // configure AWS X-Ray propagator 
```

### Using the AWS resource Detectors

The ADOT .NET SDK supports automatically recording metadata in EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, and EKS environments. You can configure the corresponding resource detector to the `TracerProvider` following the EC2 example below.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
                        // other configurations
                        .SetResourceBuilder(ResourceBuilder
                            .CreateDefault()
                            .AddDetector(new AWSEC2ResourceDetector()))
                        .Build();
```

## Instrumenting .NET Applications

Once you have configured all necessary X-Ray components to the `TracerProvider`, you can proceed to [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK's developer guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet#getting-started) to instrument your .NET application. 

OpenTelemetry provides a wide range of instrumentations for popular .NET libraries: [Asp.Net](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNet#readme), [Asp.Net Core](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore#readme), [Http](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http#readme), [Grpc](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.GrpcNetClient#readme), [Redis](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.StackExchangeRedis/README.md), [Sql](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.SqlClient#readme) and [EntityFramework](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Instrumentation.EntityFrameworkCore#readme). Instrumenting a library means that every time the library is used to make or handle a request, that library's calls are automatically wrapped within a  span. That span is automatically populated with attributes describing the values used by the library call.

### AWS SDK Instrumentation

For tracing downstream calls to AWS services from your .NET application, you will need to install the `OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Instrumentation.AWS` package.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Instrumentation.AWS
```

Call `AddAWSInstrumentation()` to add AWS SDK client instrumentation to `TracerProvider`. The below example is for an ASP.NET Core application.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Extensions.AWSXRay.Trace;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
  
    tracerProvider.AddAWSInstrumentation() // for tracing calls to AWS services via AWS SDK for .NET
                  .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
                  .AddOtlpExporter()
                  .Build();
}
```

## Custom Instrumentation

### Creating Custom Spans

In .NET, you can use the activity API to create custom spans to monitor the performance of internal activities that are not captured by instrumentation libraries. 

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

ActivitySource activitySource = new ActivitySource("ActivitySourceName", "ActivitySourceVersion");
var activity = activitySource.StartActivity("ActivityName", ActivityKind.Server); // this will be translated to a X-Ray Segment
var internalActivity = activitySource.StartActivity("ActivityName", ActivityKind.Internal); // this will be translated to an X-Ray Subsegment
```

Note that only spans of kind `Server` are converted into X-Ray segments, all other kind of spans (`Internal`, `Client`, etc.) are converted into X-Ray subsegments. For more on segments and subsegments, see the [AWS X-Ray developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-segments).

### Adding Custom Attributes

You can also add custom key-value pairs as attributes onto your spans. 

```csharp
activity.SetTag("http.method", "GET");
activity.SetTag("http.url", "http://www.mywebsite.com");
```

Attributes are converted to metadata by default. If you configure your collector, you can convert some or all of the attributes to annotations. To read more about X-Ray annotations and metadata see the [AWS X-Ray developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-annotations).

For more information about the activity API, see the [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK's developer guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Api#instrumenting-a-libraryapplication-with-net-activity-api).
