description:
    OpenTelemetry provides different language SDKs to instrument code for collecting telemetry data in the application.
    In this tutorial, we will introduce how to use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry .NET Auto-Instrumentation for traces and metrics instrumentation in the application.

## Introduction

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) .NET Auto-Instrumentation use [Host startup hook](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/host-startup-hook.md)
and [CLR Profiler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/) to be injected into .NET application for gathering
telemetry data from a diverse set of libraries and frameworks. The ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation will automatically insturment application code at startup
to collect tracing data. It is preconfigured for compatibility with X-Ray and AWS services but can also be used with any
other tracing backend. Out of the box, it propagates traces using all of W3C Trace Context, B3, and X-Amzn-Trace-Id.

## Requirements

The ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation is compatible for all the officially supported versions of [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) and [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework).

Note: Youâ€™ll also need to have the [ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Installation

Download the installation script of [latest version](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-dotnet-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-otel-dotnet-install.sh).

If you'd prefer to pin to a specific version, check out our [releases](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-dotnet-instrumentation/releases).

The ADOT .NET NuGet package is also published in [NuGet repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWS.Distro.OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation).

## Running an Application with Auto-Instrumentation
The ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation could be installed by running installation script `aws-otel-dotnet-install.sh` or manually download packages from GitHub.
To run your app with the ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation, setup environment variables with script `instrument.sh` before starting up your application,
pointing to the downloaded ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation artifact. In addition, while not required by the ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation itself,
almost all tracing systems require a service name and service namespace defined to identify your application, which you can specify
with the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable and `service.name` / `service.namespace` attribute keys.
```
. $HOME/.otel-dotnet-auto/instrument.sh
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=MyApp,service.namespace=MyTeam 
```

The above command will setup your application with the ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation activated, and instrumentation is then activated
automatically when your applicaiton start. For many cases, this is all you need to use tracing.

### Configuring Auto-Instrumentation

By default ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation uses the [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol)
and is configured to send data to a [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md)
at `http://localhost:4317` for both metrics and traces.

The ADOT .NET auto-Instrumentation can be configured with environment variables as the primary way.
For example, to set the random sampling rate for creating traces, you can set the environment variables
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio` and `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.3` to configure a sampling rate of 30%.

More SDK configuration can be found in upstream [OpenTelemetry SDK Configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/)
and [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK Configuraiton](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/config.md).

### Using CloudWatch Application Signals

You can use CloudWatch Application Signals to automatically instrument your applications on AWS using ADOT .NET auto-instrumentation so that you can monitor current application health and track long-term application performance against your business objectives. Application Signals provides you with a unified, application-centric view of your applications, services, and dependencies, and helps you monitor and triage application health.

[Get started with CloudWatch Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Monitoring-Sections.html)

### Using X-Ray Remote Sampling

The ADOT .NET Auto-Instrumentation can be configured to use [X-Ray remote sampling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html)
by setting the environment variable `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=xray`. You will also need to [configure the OpenTelemetry collector](/docs/getting-started/remote-sampling)
to allow the application to fetch sampling configuration. By default the sampler sends requests to `http://localhost:2000`. By setting `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` 
environment variable you can change the endpoint the sampler talks with when getting sampling configuration from AWS X-Ray Console. For example setting 
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=endpoint=http://localhost:4000` would configure the sampler to communicate with `http://localhost:4000`.

## Using Manual Instrumentation

Because there can only be one global `TracerProvider` and `MeterProvider`, manual instrumentation should not instantiate its own `TracerProvider` or `MeterProvider` if used together alongside auto-instrumentation. 
Given that the same `TracerProvider` and `MeterProvider` is used, custom tracing and metrics works the same way when using automatic instrumentation or manual instrumentation.
For information about custom trace instrumentation, see our [docs on manual instrumentation](/docs/getting-started/dotnet-sdk/manual-instr).
