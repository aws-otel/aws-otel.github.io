## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To build AWS OTel Collector locally, you will need to have Golang installed. You can download and install Golang [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Try out AWS OTel Collector 
AWS OTel Collector supports all AWS computing platforms and docker/kubernetes. Here are some examples on how to run AWS OTel Collector to send telemetry data:
* [Run it with Docker](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/docker-demo.md)
* [Run it with ECS](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/ecs-demo.md)
* [Run it with EKS](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/eks-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Linux EC2](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/linux-rpm-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Windows EC2](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/windows-other-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Debian EC2](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/debian-deb-demo.md)

When setting up the collector, you will need to decide between sidecar and service deployment and can find more
information about these two patterns [here](/docs/getting-started/collector/sidecar-vs-service).

### Build Your Own Artifacts
Use the following instruction to build your own AWS OTel Collector artifacts:
* [Build Docker Image](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/build-docker.md)
* [Build RPM/Deb/MSI](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/build-aoc.md)
