In this guide, we provide some advanced configurations for the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Collector-AWS Managed Service 
for Prometheus (AMP) Pipeline. 

For an overview on what the pipeline is or for more basic configurations, please take a look at this 
[Getting Started with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector-AMP Pipeline in EKS Guide](/docs/getting-started/prometheus-remote-write-exporter).

## Prometheus Receiver Configurations

The Prometheus Receiver provides many configurations to perform service discovery, metric scraping, and metric re-labelling.

Note that each of these configurations requires its own Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions in order to access the kube-api and 
discover scrape targets. These requirements can be found [here](#permissions).

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Additional Kubernetes/EKS Scraping Configurations

To monitor your Kubernetes applications and clusters, we specifically use the `kubernetes_sd_configs`. We can choose between various Kubernetes 
objects to discover and scrape including endpoints, pods, nodes, services and ingresses. For each of these objects, we provide a default configuration.

#### Endpoints 

The Prometheus Receiver monitors each applications deployment using the service endpoints. Specifically, it scrapes and collects metrics from the 
`/metrics` endpoint. In order to create and expose these metrics, we use the [Prometheus client libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/).

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
- job_name: 'kubernetes-service-endpoints'
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: endpoints

  relabel_configs:
  # Example relabel to scrape only endpoints that have
  # "prometheus.io/scrape = true" annotation.
  # - action: keep
  #   regex: true
  #   source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
  # Example relabel to configure scrape scheme for all service scrape targets
  # based on endpoints "prometheus.io/scrape_scheme = <scheme>" annotation.
  # - action: replace
  #   regex: (https?)
  #   source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_scheme]
  #   target_label: __scheme__
  # Example relabel to customize metric path based on endpoints
  # "prometheus.io/path = <metric path>" annotation.
  # - action: replace
  #   regex: (.+)
  #   source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
  #   target_label: __metrics_path__
  # Example relabel to scrape only single, desired port for the service based
  # on endpoints "prometheus.io/scrape_port = <port>" annotation.
  # - action: replace
  #   regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)?;(\d+)
  #   replacement: $$1:$$2
  #   source_labels: [__address__,__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
  #   target_label: __address__
  - action: labelmap
    regex: __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)      
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
    target_label: Namespace
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
    target_label: Service
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name]
    target_label: kubernetes_node
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
    target_label: pod_name
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name]
    target_label: container_name

  # Exclude high cardinality metrics
  metric_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'go_gc_duration_seconds.*'
    action: drop
```

### Pods 

A pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. 
When monitoring pods, we want to watch the pod deployment patterns, total pod instances, and expected vs. actual pod instances.

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
- job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
  sample_limit: 10000
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: pod
  relabel_configs:
  # Example relabel to scrape only endpoints that have
  # "prometheus.io/scrape = true" annotation.
  # - action: keep
  #  regex: true
  #  source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
  # Example relabel to configure scrape scheme for all service scrape targets
  # based on endpoints "prometheus.io/scrape_scheme = <scheme>" annotation.
  # - action: replace
  #  regex: (https?)
  #  source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_scheme]
  #  target_label: __scheme__
  # Example relabel to customize metric path based on endpoints
  # "prometheus.io/path = <metric path>" annotation.
  # - action: replace
  #  regex: (.+)
  #  source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
  #  target_label: __metrics_path__
  # Example relabel to scrape only single, desired port for the service based
  # on endpoints "prometheus.io/scrape_port = <port>" annotation.
  # - action: labelmap
  #  regex: __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
    target_label: Namespace
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
    target_label: pod_name
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name]
    target_label: container_name
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_controller_name]
    target_label: pod_controller_name
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_controller_kind]
    target_label: pod_controller_kind
  - action: replace
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_phase]
    target_label: pod_phase

  metric_relabel_configs:
  - action: drop
    source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'go_gc_duration_seconds.*'
```

### Kubernetes (k8s) API Server

The [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) provides REST operations and the 
front-end to the cluster’s shared state through which all other components interact. Key metrics to watch for include: the number and 
duration of requests for each combination of resource (including pods, Deployments, etc.) as well as the operation (such as GET, LIST, POST, DELETE).

The TLS configurations give us access to the k8s objects.

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
- job_name: 'kubernetes-apiservers'
  sample_limit: 10000
  # Default to scraping over https. If required, just disable this or change to
  # `http`.
  scheme: https
  
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: endpoints
  tls_config:
    ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
    insecure_skip_verify: true
  bearer_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
  
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name, __meta_kubernetes_endpoint_port_name]
    action: keep
    regex: kubernetes;https
```

Some types of metrics we can receive from the API server include:

| Metric                                | Description                                                               | Metric Type       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| apiserver\_request\_duration\_seconds | Count of requests to the API server for a specific resource and verb      | Work: Throughput  |
| workqueue\_queue\_duration\_seconds   | Total number of seconds that items spent waiting in a specific work queue | Work: Performance |
| workqueue\_work\_duration\_seconds    | Total number of seconds spent processing items in a specific work queue   | Work: Performance |

<SubSectionSeparator />

### cAdvisor

The cAdvisor is an agent integrated into the kubelet binary to monitor the resource usage and analyze the performance of **containers**. 
Key metrics collected by the cAdvisor include the CPU, memory, file, and network usage for containers running on a given node.

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
- job_name: 'kubernetes-cadvisor'
  sample_limit: 10000
  # Default to scraping over https. If required, just disable this or change to
  # `http`.
  scheme: https
  metrics_path: /metrics/cadvisor
  
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: node
  tls_config:
    ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
    insecure_skip_verify: true
  bearer_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
  
  relabel_configs:
    - action: labelmap
      regex: __meta_kubernetes_node_label_(.+)
```

Types of metrics we can receive from the cAdvisor include:

| Metric                                 | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| container\_cpu\_load\_average\_10s     | Value of container cpu load average over the last 10 seconds. |
| container\_cpu\_system\_seconds\_total | Cumulative system cpu time consumed in seconds.               |
| container\_last\_seen                  | Last time a container was seen by the exporter                |
| container\_memory\_failcnt             | Number of memory usage hits limits                            |
| container\_memory\_failures\_total     | Cumulative count of memory allocation failures.               |

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Nodes

Kubernetes nodes are the virtual or physical machines that run our workloads. Key metrics to watch for nodes 
mainly report on resource utilization including allocatable memory/CPU and CPU/disk utilization.

```yaml lineNumbers=true
- job_name: 'kubernetes-nodes'
  sample_limit: 10000
  # Default to scraping over https. If required, just disable this or change to
  # `http`.
  scheme: https
  
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: node
  tls_config:
    ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
    insecure_skip_verify: true
  bearer_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
  
  relabel_configs:
    - action: labelmap
      regex: __meta_kubernetes_node_label_(.+)
```

Types of metrics we receive from the cAdvisor include:

| Metric                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| kubelet\_cgroup\_manager\_duration\_seconds     | Duration in seconds for cgroup manager operations. Broken down by method.                                                                                            |
| kubelet\_node\_config\_error                    | This metric is true (1) if the node is experiencing a configuration-related error, false (0) otherwise.                                                              |
| kubelet\_pleg\_relist\_duration\_seconds        | Duration in seconds for relisting pods in PLEG (pod lifecycle event generator).                                                                                      |
| kubelet\_pod\_start\_duration\_seconds          | Duration in seconds for a single pod to go from pending to running.                                                                                                  |
| kubelet\_pod\_worker\_duration\_seconds         | Duration in seconds to sync a single pod. Broken down by operation type: create, update, or sync                                                                     |
| kubelet\_running\_pod\_count                    | Number of pods currently running                                                                                                                                     |

### Services

A service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service. The services define a logical set of pods 
and a policy by which to access them, enabling decoupling between pods. The important metrics to consider for services is the health of that 
service. We can use the [Blackbox Exporter provided by Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter) to probe endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP and ICMP. 

#### Prerequisite

To use the blackbox exporter, ** we can deploy the configurations 
[here](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/examples/eks/aws-prometheus/prometheus-blackbox-exporter.yaml).

Using the name of the Blackbox Exporter service and the exposed port (9115), we can access the probed metrics. This is done by 
replacing the `__address__`. If we do not want to probe all services, we can specify a list of target addresses to probe in the `static_configs` 
(more information can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/)).

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
- job_name: 'kubernetes-services'
  sample_limit: 10000
  metrics_path: /probe
  params:
    module: [http_2xx]
    
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: service
  
  relabel_configs:
  # Example relabel to probe only some services that have "prometheus.io/should_be_probed = true" annotation
  # - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_should_be_probed]
  #  action: keep
  #  regex: true
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: __param_target
  - target_label: __address__
    replacement: blackbox-exporter-service:9115
  - source_labels: [__param_target]
    target_label: instance
  - action: labelmap
    regex: __meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+)
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
    target_label: kubernetes_namespace
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
    target_label: kubernetes_name
```

Some types of metrics we can receive from the service probing include:

| Metric                                  | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| probe\_duration\_seconds                | Returns how long the probe took to complete in seconds |
| probe\_http\_status\_code               | Response HTTP status code                              |
| probe\_http\_uncompressed\_body\_length | Length of uncompressed response body                   |
| probe\_success                          | Displays whether or not the probe was a success        |


<SubSectionSeparator />

### Ingresses

A Kubernetes ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster. Similar to services, the important metrics to 
consider is the health of the ingress. We can use the [Blackbox Exporter provided by Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter) 
to probe endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP and ICMP. 

As setup in `services`, this will also require the Blackbox Exporter.

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
- job_name: 'kubernetes-ingresses'
  sample_limit: 10000
  metrics_path: /probe
  params:
    module: [http_2xx]

  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: ingress
  
  relabel_configs:
  # Example relabel to probe only some services that have "prometheus.io/should_be_probed = true" annotation
  # - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_should_be_probed]
  #  action: keep
  #  regex: true
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_ingress_scheme,__address__,__meta_kubernetes_ingress_path]
    regex: (.+);(.+);(.+)
    replacement: $${1}://$${2}$${3}
    target_label: __param_target
  - target_label: __address__
    replacement: blackbox-exporter-service:9115
  - source_labels: [__param_target]
    target_label: instance
  - action: labelmap
    regex: __meta_kubernetes_ingress_label_(.+)
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
    target_label: kubernetes_namespace
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_ingress_name]
    target_label: kubernetes_name
```

Some types of metrics that we can receive from the service probing include:

| Metric                                  | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| probe\_duration\_seconds                | Returns how long the probe took to complete in seconds |
| probe\_http\_status\_code               | Response HTTP status code                              |
| probe\_http\_uncompressed\_body\_length | Length of uncompressed response body                   |
| probe\_success                          | Displays whether or not the probe was a success        |

*Notice that these metrics are similar to the service metrics above (as they are both probing metrics). The difference will lie in the labels.*

## Permissions

### Kubernetes API Server

If you are scraping for kube-system components and the API server, the endpoints need to be enabled for private access. More information 
on this can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html#cluster-endpoint-access-console). 

<SubSectionSeparator />

### RBAC for Other Kubernetes Resources

In order for service discovery and scraping to work, the ADOT Collector pod may need permissions to get and list objects of the EKS cluster.
 By default, the OTel Collector uses the default service account to communicate with the API server. We can set a ClusterRoleBinding for this 
 service account such that it can access and scrape the necessary metric endpoints.

Example configuration:

```lineNumbers=true 
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otelcol-rbac
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: otelcol
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
```

If necessary, we can restrict the service account access to the specific Kubernetes resources we want to scrape. For instance, if we were 
specifically scraping for pod-level metrics, we could use the following ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding:

```lineNumbers=true 
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: prom-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
- nonResourceURLs:
  - /metrics
  verbs:
  - get
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prom-rbac
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: otelcol
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: prom-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
```

To scrape Node or cAdvisor metrics, we need to provide the service account access to `nodes/metrics`. As an example, 
the following ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding should work for Pod, Node, Service, and cAdvisor metrics. 

```lineNumbers=true 
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: prom-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
    - nodes
    - nodes/proxy
    - nodes/metrics
    - services
    - endpoints
    - pods
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- nonResourceURLs:
  - /metrics
  verbs:
  - get
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prom-rbac
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: otelcol
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: prom-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
```

## AWS Prometheus Remote Write Exporter Configurations

For the AWS Prometheus Remote Write Exporter to sign your HTTP requests with AWS SigV4 (AWS’ authentication protocol for secure authentication), 
you will need to provide the aws_auth configurations. If aws_auth is not provided, HTTPs requests will not be signed.

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
exporters:
  awsprometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: "https://aws-managed-prometheus-endpoint/v1/api/remote_write"
    aws_auth:
      service: "aps"
      region: "user-region"
```

Aside from the auth configurations, the AWS Prometheus Remote Write Exporter is also configurable with retry, sending queue, and timeout 
settings. An example of these configurations is provided below.

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
exporters:
  awsprometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: "https://aps-workspaces-gamma.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workspaces/ws-7cd45747-2381-4a2a-847f-fa61a3694a74/api/v1/remote_write"
    namespace: test
    auth:
      region: "us-east-1"
      service: "aps"
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 10s
      max_elabsed_time: 30s
    timeout: 15s
```

More information on the possible retry, sending queue, and timeout configurations can be found 
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/master/exporter/exporterhelper#configuration).

## Takeaway

These advanced configurations should enable you to monitor your applications and Kubernetes cluster in a secure and reliable manner.
