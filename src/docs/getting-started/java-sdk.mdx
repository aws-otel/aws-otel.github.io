# Getting Started with the Java SDK on Traces and Metrics Instrumentation

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Java refers to some components developed to complement the upstream
[OpenTelemetry (OTel) Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java) and
[OTel Java Auto-Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). Below are links
to guides that go over how to configure the relevant components of OpenTelemetry to send trace data to the AWS X-Ray
backend.

## Getting Started

* [Auto-Instrumentation for Traces with the Java agent](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/trace-auto-instr)
* [Manual Instrumentation for Traces with the Java SDK](/docs/getting-started/java-sdk/trace-manual-instr)

## Sample Code
