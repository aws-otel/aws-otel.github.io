The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Java refers to some components developed to complement the upstream
[OpenTelemetry (OTel) Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java) and
[OTel Java Auto-Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). Below are links
to guides that go over how to configure the relevant components of OpenTelemetry to send trace data to the AWS X-Ray
backend.
