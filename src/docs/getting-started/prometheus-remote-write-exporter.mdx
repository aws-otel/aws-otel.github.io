In order to scrape and export metrics to your AWS Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) instance, you can use either the AWS Distro for 
the OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) or a standard vanilla Prometheus server.

In this Getting Started guide, we’ll show you how to configure the ADOT Collector to scrape from a Prometheus-instrumented application, 
and send metrics to the AWS Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP).

## Before you Begin

The ADOT-AMP pipeline enables us to use the ADOT Collector to scrape a Prometheus-instrumented application, and send the scraped metrics 
to AWS Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP). 

<img src={prometheusPipelineEKSImg} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

The ADOT-AMP pipeline includes two OpenTelemetry Collector components specific to Prometheus — the Prometheus Receiver and the AWS Prometheus 
Remote Write Exporter.

## Components in our Pipeline

### Prometheus Receiver

The Prometheus Receiver supports the full set of Prometheus scraping and re-labeling configurations described 
[here](http://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/). You should be able to directly paste in these configurations into your 
ADOT Collector configurations. 

The configuration for the Prometheus Receiver will include your service discovery, scraping configurations, and re-labeling configurations. The 
receiver configurations will look like this:

```yaml lineNumbers=true
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      [Your Prometheus configurations]
```

An example configuration is shown below. 

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      global:
        scrape_interval: 1m
        scrape_timeout: 10s
        
      scrape_configs:
      - job_name: kubernetes-service-endpoints
        sample_limit: 10000
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: endpoints
```

**Note:** To perform Kubernetes service discovery, you will need to set up the proper permissions and RBAC authorization for the service account 
(to allow it to access the Kubernetes API). Please refer to the Permissions section in the 
[advanced configurations doc](/docs/getting-started/advanced-prometheus-remote-write-configurations).

**Note: If you have existing Prometheus configurations, you will need to replace the `$` characters with `$$` to avoid having the value replaced with environment variables. **
This is especially important for the `replacement` value of the relabel_configurations. For instance, the following configuration for relabel_configurations below 

```
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_ingress_scheme,__address__,__meta_kubernetes_ingress_path]
  regex: (.+);(.+);(.+)
  replacement: ${1}://${2}${3}
  target_label: __param_target
```

would become 

```
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_ingress_scheme,__address__,__meta_kubernetes_ingress_path]
  regex: (.+);(.+);(.+)
  replacement: $${1}://${2}${3}
  target_label: __param_target
```

### AWS Prometheus Remote Write Exporter

The configuration for the AWS Prometheus Remote Write Exporter is a lot simpler than the Prometheus receiver. At this stage in the pipeline, metrics 
have already been ingested, and we’re ready to export this data to AMP. The minimum requirement for a successful configuration to communicate with AMP is as follows:

```yaml lineNumbers=true 
exporters:
  awsprometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: "https://aws-managed-prometheus-endpoint/v1/api/remote_write"
    aws_auth:
      service: "aps"
      region: "user-region"
```

This configuration sends an HTTPS request that is signed by AWS SigV4 using the credentials that are set up from the prerequisites section. It is 
mandatory that customers specify the service to be “aps”

Regardless of the method of deployment, the ADOT Collector must have access to one of the listed options in the 
[default AWS credentials chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html). The AWS Prometheus Remote Write 
Exporter depends on the AWS Go SDK and uses it to fetch credentials and authenticate. You must ensure that these credentials have remote writing 
permissions to AMP (`aps:RemoteWrite`).

## Conclusion 

This document has gone over what the basic requirements are to get set up with the ADOT Collector to collect and export Prometheus metrics to AMP. 
With this, you should be able to use the aforementioned tools to have a clean solution to observability on your software systems.
