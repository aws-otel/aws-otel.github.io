Welcome to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Go (ADOT Go) getting started guide. This walkthrough covers the ADOT Go components, how to 
configure the ADOT components for traces with OpenTelemetry Go and AWS X-Ray, as well as how to use the AWS Elastic Container Service 
(AWS ECS) and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS) resource detectors. Before reading this guide, you should familiarize with 
distributed tracing and the basics of OpenTelemetry. To learn more about getting started with OpenTelemetry Go, see the 
[OpenTelemetry developer documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/go/).

## Installation and Configuration

To get started with ADOT Go, create a new directory for your project and add a new file inside called `main.go`. Open up your command line 
interface (CLI) and run the command `go mod init main` in the same directory, which will create a `go.mod` file. This file is used by Go to manage imports. 

To install the necessary prerequisites, run the following command in the same directory that the `go.mod` file is in:

```bash
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel 
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk 
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp 
go get go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/propagators/aws/xray
```

In your `main.go` file, add the following imports:

```go lineNumbers=true
package main

import (
    "context"
    
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/global"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/propagators/aws/xray"
    sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)
```

The packages above contain only the basic requirements for using OpenTelemetry Go with AWS X-Ray. The specific libraries and packages that 
are used will vary greatly depending on the type of application and what features you need. Check out the full list of 
[libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/master/instrumentation#instrumentation) that contains 
instrumentation for 3rd-party Go packages and some packages from the standard library.

## Creating an OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) Exporter

<img src={goImg2} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

OpenTelemetry Go requires an exporter to send traces to a backend. Exporters allow telemetry data to be transferred either to the AWS 
Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector), or to a remote system or console for further analysis. 

The ADOT Collector is a separate process that is designed to be a ‘sink’ for telemetry data emitted by many processes, which can then export 
that data to back-end systems. The base components vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process and export telemetry data. 

To initialize the OTLP exporter, add the following code to the file the `main.go` file -

```go lineNumbers=true 
creds, err := credentials.NewClientTLSFromFile("my-cert.pem", "")
if err != nil {
    // Handle error here...
}

// Create new OTLP Exporter
exporter, err := otlp.NewExporter(
    otlp.WithTLSCredentials(creds), 
    otlp.WithAddress(<INSERT LISTEN ADDRESS HERE>),
)
    
if err != nil {
    // Handle error here...
}
```

This creates a new OTLP exporter with a few options - `WithTLSCredentials()` is a way to intialize gRPC TransportCredentials and you can learn more about it 
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/credentials#TransportCredentials), and `WithAddress()` allows you to set the address 
that the exporter will connect to the Collector on. If the address is unset, it will instead try to use connect to `DefaultCollectorHost:DefaultCollectorPort`.

If the Collector you are connecting to does not use TLS, for example in a [sidecar deployment](/docs/getting-started/collector/sidecar-vs-service),
then pass `otlp.WithInsecure()` instead to `otlp.NewExporter`.

## Creating a Tracer Provider 

Tracing refers to the practice used by engineers and developers to analyze application code. Traditionally, this was done through using various 
different debugging tools and programming techniques. As applications evolved and adopted the microservices architecture, tracing now refers 
to distributed tracing. This term refers to tracing a path that a request takes as it goes through different services and processes in a 
multi-service architecture design. To define a trace more precisely in OpenTelemetry terms, it is essentially a group of linked spans, which 
represent a unit of work in a request. The spans can have information attached such as a name and other data describing the timed operation. 
Every trace consists of at least a root span and can have zero or more child spans. The root span describes the end-to-end latency of the entire 
trace, while child spans representing sub-operations. 

<img src={goImg3} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

In order to generate traces, OpenTelemetry Go requires a trace provider to be created. A Trace provider can have multiple different span processors, 
which are components that give the ability to modify and export span data after it has been created. 

To create a new trace provider, add the following lines to the `main.go` file:

```go lineNumbers=true 
cfg := sdktrace.Config{
    DefaultSampler: sdktrace.AlwaysSample(),
}
   
idg := xray.NewIDGenerator()

tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
    sdktrace.WithConfig(cfg),
    sdktrace.WithSyncer(exporter),
    sdktrace.WithIDGenerator(idg),
)
```

The block of code above will create a new `TracerProvider` with a Sampler that samples every trace, and an ID Generator that 
will generate trace IDs that conform to AWS X-Ray’s format, as well as register the OLTP exporter we created in the previous section.

## Setting Global Options

In this section we will be setting a global tracer provider since its good practice when using OpenTelemetry Go. By doing this, it will make it easier 
for other libraries/dependencies that use the OpenTelemetry API to easily discover the SDK and emit telemetry data. 

In addition to setting a global tracer provider, we will also configure the context propagation option. Context propagation refers to sharing data across 
multiple processes or services. This ability to correlate information across service boundaries is one of the principal concepts behind distributed tracing. 
To find these correlations, components in a distributed system need to be able to collect, store, and transfer metadata referred to as context. Propagator 
structs are configured inside Tracer structs in order to support transferring of context across process boundaries. A context will often have information 
identifying the current span and trace, and can contain arbitrary correlations as key-value pairs. Propagation is when context is bundled and transferred 
across services, often via HTTP headers. 

To set up global options, we will use the global package and add the following lines to the `main.go` file: 

```go lineNumbers=true 
global.SetTracerProvider(tp)
global.SetTextMapPropagator(xray.Propagator{})
```

## Demo Walkthrough 

Let’s take the concepts we’ve just covered in the previous section and create a demo application. In this application we will be creating a HTTP 
application with one endpoint called /hello-world. When a client hits this endpoint, the server will return a simple response containing a string 
saying “Hello World”. The goal of this example application is to show you how to instrument send traces to AWS X-Ray using OpenTelemetry Go. 

<SubSectionSeparator />

### Setting up a Router Using Mux

The first thing we need to do is create the `/hello-world` endpoint. To do this, we will be using a routing package in Go called 
[Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux). To install this package, run the following command:

```
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

Now that we have Mux installed, let’s go ahead and make a new `main.go` file. In this file, we will first create a new router using Mux. Then, we will 
define the `/hello-world` endpoint and pass in a function called `handler()`, which will return “Hello World”. Finally, we will call the `http.ListenAndServe()` 
function to start our server and listen on port :8080.

The file should look something like this:

```go lineNumbers=true 
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func main() {

    // Create a new HTTP router to handle incoming client requests
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    
    // When client makes GET request to /hello-world
    // handler() will execute
    r.HandleFunc("/hello-world", handler).Methods(http.MethodGet)
    
    // Start the server and listen on localhost:8080
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}

// Function for handling the /hello-world endpoint
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

    // Set the header content-type and return hello world
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode("hello world")
    
}
```

To start the server we will use the `go run` command to build and execute our `main.go` file. To do this, open up your command line interface and navigate 
to the directory that contains your `main.go` file. Once you’re in the directory execute the following command to run the `main.go` file and start the server on port 8080.

```
$ go run main.go
```

After starting the server, we can test that it works by opening up the browser and typing in `localhost:8080/hello-world` , you should now see “Hello World” printed to the screen! 

*Note: Make sure the [aws-otel-collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) is properly set up and running*

### Instrument our Application

Now that we have a simple HTTP server set up with one endpoint, it’s time to instrument our application with OpenTelemetry Go so that we can start tracing requests. 
To do this, we will first create a helper function called `initTracer()`, where we include all the instrumentation code. In this helper function, we will 
instantiate a new OTLP exporter struct. Then, we will create a new `TracerProvider` struct and pass in configuration options such as a custom ID Generator, 
which will be used for sending the traces to AWS X-Ray . The last part of this function is specifying the `TracerProvider` struct that we want to use, as well as the propagator. 

The function should look something like this:

```go lineNumbers=true 
func initTracer() {

    // Create new OTLP Exporter struct
    driver := otlpgrpc.NewDriver(
	 otlpgrpc.WithInsecure(),
	 otlpgrpc.WithEndpoint("localhost:30080"),
	 otlpgrpc.WithDialOption(grpc.WithBlock()), // useful for testing
    )
    
    exporter, err := otlp.NewExporter(ctx, driver)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error here...
    }

    // AlwaysSample() returns a Sampler that samples every trace.
    // Be careful about using this sampler in a production application with
    // significant traffic: a new trace will be started and exported for every request.
    cfg := sdktrace.Config{
        DefaultSampler: sdktrace.AlwaysSample(),
    }
    
    // A custom ID Generator to generate traceIDs that conform to
    // AWS X-Ray traceID format
    idg := xray.NewIDGenerator()

    // Create a new TraceProvider object passing in the config, the exporter
    // and the ID Generator we want to use for our tracing
    tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
        sdktrace.WithConfig(cfg),
        sdktrace.WithSyncer(exporter),
        sdktrace.WithIDGenerator(idg),
    )

    // Set the traceprovider and the propagator we want to use
    otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
    otel.SetTextMapPropagator(xray.Propagator{})
}
```

Please note, if your Collector is using TLS, usually because it is deployed as a [service](/docs/getting-started/collector/sidecar-vs-service),
you will need to use `otlp.WithTLSCredentials` instead of `otlp.WithInsecure`.

After creating the `initTracer()` function, we can now call it in our `main()` function, along with creating a new tracer and giving it a 
name of “demo-app”. In addition to initializing a tracer, we also need to add a line to allow the ADOT Collector to act as a middleware in 
order to intercept requests and send those traces to AWS X-Ray. 

The updated `main()` function should now look something like this:

```go lineNumbers=true highlight={3,4,9}
func main() {

    initTracer()
    tracer := otel.Tracer("demo-app")
    
    // Create a new HTTP router to handle incoming client requests
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    
    r.Use(otelmux.Middleware("my-server"))
    
    // When client makes GET request to /hello-world, handler() will execute
    r.HandleFunc("/hello-world", handler).Methods(http.MethodGet)
    
    // Start the server and listen on localhost:8080
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}
```

Once again, we will start our server by using the following command and then visiting `localhost:8080/hello-world`. 

```
$ go run main.go
```

Now, along with seeing “Hello World” printed to the browser, you can also log into your AWS X-Ray Console and see that there is a new trace 
request for the `/hello-world` endpoint. 

<img src={goImg4} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

The completed `main.go` file should now look something like this:

```go lineNumbers=true 
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/gorilla/mux/otelmux"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/propagators/aws/xray"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlpgrpc"

	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

var tracer = otel.Tracer("demo-app")

func main() {

	initTracer()

	// Create a new HTTP router to handle incoming client requests
	r := mux.NewRouter()

	r.Use(otelmux.Middleware("my-server"))

	// When client makes GET request to /hello-world
	// handler() will execute
	r.HandleFunc("/hello-world", handler).Methods(http.MethodGet)

	// Start the server and listen on localhost:8080
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)

}

// Function for handling the /hello-world endpoint
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

	// Set the header content-type and return hello world
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode("hello world")

}

func initTracer() {

	// Create new OTLP Exporter struct
	 driver := otlpgrpc.NewDriver(
	 	otlpgrpc.WithInsecure(),
		otlpgrpc.WithEndpoint("localhost:30080"),
	 	otlpgrpc.WithDialOption(grpc.WithBlock()), // useful for testing
        )
    
    	exporter, err := otlp.NewExporter(ctx, driver)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle error here...
	}

	// AlwaysSample() returns a Sampler that samples every trace.
	// Be careful about using this sampler in a production application with
	// significant traffic: a new trace will be started and exported for every request.
	cfg := sdktrace.Config{
		DefaultSampler: sdktrace.AlwaysSample(),
	}

	// A custom ID Generator to generate traceIDs that conform to
	// AWS X-Ray traceID format
	idg := xray.NewIDGenerator()

	// Create a new TraceProvider struct passing in the config, the exporter
	// and the ID Generator we want to use for our tracing
	tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
		sdktrace.WithConfig(cfg),
		sdktrace.WithSyncer(exporter),
		sdktrace.WithIDGenerator(idg),
	)

	// Set the traceprovider and the propagator we want to use
	otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
	otel.SetTextMapPropagator(xray.Propagator{})
}
```

Please note, if your Collector is using TLS, usually because it is deployed as a [service](/docs/getting-started/collector/sidecar-vs-service),
you will need to use `otlp.WithTLSCredentials` instead of `otlp.WithInsecure`.

## Using the AWS ECS Resource Detector

The AWS ECS Resource Detector is responsible for detecting whether or not a Go application instrumented with OpenTelemetry is running on ECS. 
If the resource detector does in fact detect that it is running on ECS, it will populate the `resource` with ECS metadata. The metadata will include 
the `containerId` and `hostName` which will be formatted as key value pairs inside the `resource` struct. If the ECS resource detector detects that the application 
is not running on ECS, then it will return an empty `resource` struct.

<img src={goImg5} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the ECS resource detector.

```go lineNumbers=true
import (
    "context"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/detectors/aws/ecs"
    sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

func main() {
    
    // Instantiate a new ECS Resource detector
    ecsResourceDetector := ecs.NewResourceDetector()
    resource, err := ecsResourceDetector.Detect(context.Background())

    //Associate resource with TracerProvider
    tracerProvider := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
        sdktrace.WithResource(resource),
    )
    
}
```

<SectionSeparator />

## Using AWS EKS Resource Detector

The AWS EKS Resource Detector is responsible for detecting whether or not a Go application instrumented with OpenTelemetry is running on EKS. If the 
EKS resource detector detects that it is running on EKS, it will then populate the `resource` struct with metadata. The metadata will include the 
`containerId` and `clusterName` which will be formatted as key value pairs. If the EKS resource detector detects that the application is not 
running on EKS, then it will return an empty `resource`.

<img src={goImg6} alt="Diagram" style="margin: 30px 0;" />

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the EKS Resource detector.

```go lineNumbers=true 
import (
    "context"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/detectors/aws/eks"
    sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

func main() {
    
    // Instantiate a new EKS Resource detector
    eksResourceDetector := eks.NewResourceDetector()
    resource, err := eksResourceDetector.Detect(context.Background())

    //Associate resource with TracerProvider
    tracerProvider := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
        sdktrace.WithResource(resource),
    )
    
}
```

## Conclusion

After reading this guide you should now have a basic understand of how to instrument Go applications with OpenTelemetry and send traces 
to AWS X-Ray. We also went through how to use the resource detectors to extract information specific to ECS and EKS environments into `resource` objects.
