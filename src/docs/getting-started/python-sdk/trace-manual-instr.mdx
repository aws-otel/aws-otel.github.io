AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Python is a distribution of [OpenTelemetry Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) 
with components to trace applications in a format compatible with the AWS X-Ray service. This enables all the features of the OpenTelemetry 
project and configures its components to create traces that can be viewed in the AWS X-Ray console and allow propagation of those contexts 
across multiple downstream AWS services.

In this tutorial, we will introduce you to how to use the manual instrumentation package for traces for use with AWS X-Ray.

## Requirements

Python 3.5+ is required to use ADOT Python. Check your currently installed python version using `python3 -V`.
For more information about supported Python versions, see the [OpenTelemetry API Python package on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-api/).
Make sure you have AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) running. To set up the collector, see 
[Getting Started with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

## Getting the SDK and dependencies

 Install the following packages from OpenTelemetry Python using pip.

```
$ pip install opentelemetry-api==0.16b1 \
              opentelemetry-sdk==0.16b1 \
              opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==0.16b1 \
              opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws==0.16b1
```

OpenTelemetry Python distributes many packages, which provide instrumentation for well-known Python dependencies. You need to install the relevant 
instrumentation package for every dependency you want to generate traces for. To see supported frameworks and libraries, check out 
the [OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/?s=python).

```
# Supported instrumentation packages for the dependencies of the example above
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask==0.16b1
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore==0.16b1
```

## Configure the components and instrumentors

Add imports for OpenTelemetry packages.

```python lineNumbers=true
# Basic packages for your application
import boto3
from flask import Flask
import json

# Add imports for OTel components into the application
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.trace import SpanKind
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchExportSpanProcessor

# Import the AWS X-Ray for OTel Python IDs Generator into the application.
from opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.trace import AwsXRayIdsGenerator
```

Configure the Global Tracer Provider to export to the ADOT Collector.

```python lineNumbers=true
# Sends generated traces in the OTLP format to an ADOT Collector running on port 55678
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="localhost:55678", insecure=True)
# Processes traces in batches as opposed to immediately one after the other
span_processor = BatchExportSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
# Configures the Global Tracer Provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(active_span_processor=span_processor, ids_generator=AwsXRayIdsGenerator()))
```

<div style="margin: 20px 0">
    <mark>
        Please note, we do not recommend using the insecure option. Rather, we recommend configuring either a public or private
        certificate to authenticate your session before running your application.
    </mark>
</div>

The `insecure=True` argument disables client transport security for our OTLP exporter’s connection. This will use the gRPC `insecure_channel()` 
method as explained in the [gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=insecure#grpc.insecure_channel). 
This option should never be used in production, non-sidecar deployments.

If connecting to a gRPC server on the internet running gRPC over TLS, the credentials=/path/to/cert.pem argument can be used to give a path to 
credentials to be used to establish a secure connection for the app’s exporter. The credentials at this path should be the public certificate of the 
collector, or one of its root certificates. If no certificate is found, the gRPC method ssl_channel_credentials() will attempt to “retrieve the PEM-encoded 
root certificates from a default location chosen by gRPC runtime” as explained in the 
[gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=ssl_channel_credentials).

The `endpoint=` argument allows you to set the address that the exporter will use to connect to the collector. If the address is unset, it will 
instead try to connect to `localhost:55680`.

### Instrumenting packages

To enable tracing through your package dependencies, you need to import and initialize the relevant instrumentor classes. Instrumentors have individual 
initialization requirements, so refer to the instrumentor’s package README.md for configuration details.

To enable tracing through your package dependencies, you need to import and initialize the relevant instrumentor classes. Instrumentors have individual 
initialization requirements, so refer to the instrumentor’s package README.md for configuration details.

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.botocore import BotocoreInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor

# Initialize instumentor for Botocore
BotocoreInstrumentor().instrument()
# Initialize instumentor for Flask web framework
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
```

### Setting the global propagators

To allow the span context to propagate downstream when the application makes calls to external services, configure the global propagator. 
Set the `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` environment variable to use to the AWS X-Ray Propagator.

```
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=aws_xray
```

Alternatively, you can set the global propagator in code. Configure the propagator before your main function, as shown below.

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry import propagators
from opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.trace.propagation.aws_xray_format import AwsXRayFormat

propagators.set_global_textmap(AwsXRayFormat())
```

## Adding custom tracing

You can add additional custom tracing in your application code using the tracer as shown in the following.

```python lineNumbers=true
# Get a tracer from the Global Tracer Provider
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    # ... application code
    
    # start a new span
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("app landing page root span"):
        print('Started a root span')
        
        # start a nested new span
        with tracer.start_span("app landing page child span"):
            print('Started a child span')
            ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
            result = ec2_client.describe_instances()
            print('EC2 Describe Instances: ', json.dumps(result, default=str, indent=4))
            return '<h1>Good job! Traces recorded!</h1>'
```
