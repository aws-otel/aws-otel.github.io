## Introduction

With OpenTelemetry Python manual instrumentation, you configure the OpenTelemetry SDK within your application's code. It automatically produces spans with telemetry data describing the values used by the Python frameworks in your application with only a few lines of code. This telemetry data can then be exported to a backend like AWS X-Ray using the ADOT Python `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws` package. We also strongly recommend using the `opentelemetry-propagator-aws-xray` package to support propagating the trace context across AWS services. This propagator handles the extraction and injecting of the [AWS X-Ray Tracing header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader) for requests from or to remote services.

In this guide, we walk through the steps needed to trace an application with auto instrumentation.

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or later is required to run an application using OpenTelemetry.

Note: You’ll also need to have the [ADOT Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) running to export traces to X-Ray.

## Installation

Install the following packages and their dependencies from OpenTelemetry Python using pip.

```bash
$ pip install opentelemetry-sdk==1.11.1 \ 
              opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws~=2.0 \
              opentelemetry-propagator-aws-xray~=1.0 \
              opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.11.1 \
```

OpenTelemetry Python distributes many packages, which provide instrumentation for well-known Python dependencies. You need to install the relevant instrumentation package for every dependency you want to generate traces for. To see supported frameworks and libraries, check out the [OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/?s=python&component=instrumentation).

For example, use pip to install the follow instrumentation libraries:

```bash
# Supported instrumentation packages for the dependencies of the example above
$ pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask==0.30b1 \
              opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests==0.30b1
```

## Setting up the Global Tracer

### Sending Traces to AWS X-Ray

As soon as possible in your application code, add imports for the OpenTelemetry packages installed above.

```python lineNumbers=true
# Basic packages for your application
import boto3
from flask import Flask
import json

# Add imports for OTel components into the application
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchExportSpanProcessor

# Import the AWS X-Ray for OTel Python IDs Generator into the application.
from opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.trace import AwsXRayIdsGenerator
```

Next, configure the Global Tracer Provider to export to the ADOT Collector. The configuration of your SDK exporter depends on how you wish to connect with your configured ADOT Collector.

Connecting to an ADOT Collector running as a sidecar, we can set up the TracerProvider as follows:

```python lineNumbers=true
# Sends generated traces in the OTLP format to an ADOT Collector running on port 4317
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317")
# Processes traces in batches as opposed to immediately one after the other
span_processor = BatchExportSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
# Configures the Global Tracer Provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(active_span_processor=span_processor, ids_generator=AwsXRayIdsGenerator()))
```

The `endpoint=` argument allows you to set the address that the exporter will use to connect to the collector. If unset, the SDK will try to connect to `http://localhost:4317` by default. Note that because the scheme is `http` by default, you have to explicitly set it to be `https` if necessary.

If the Collector the application will connect to is running without TLS configured, the `http` scheme is used to disable client transport security for our OTLP exporter’s connection. This will use the gRPC `insecure_channel()` method as explained in the [gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=insecure#grpc.insecure_channel). This option should never be used in production, non-sidecar deployments.

If the Collector the application will connect to is running with TLS configured, the `https` scheme and the `credentials=/path/to/cert.pem` argument should be used to give a path to credentials that allow the application to establish a secure connection for the app’s exporter. The credentials at this path should be the public certificate of the collector, or one of its root certificates. If no certificate is found, the gRPC method `ssl_channel_credentials()` will attempt to “retrieve the PEM-encoded root certificates from a default location chosen by gRPC runtime” as explained in the [gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=ssl_channel_credentials).

Instead of setting the `IdGenerator` of the `TracerProvider` in code, you can also set the `IdGenerator` using the `OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR` environment variable:

```
OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR=xray
```

To allow the span context to propagate downstream when the application makes calls to external services, configure the global propagator to use the AWS X-Ray Propagator, which is found in the `opentelemetry-propagator-aws-xray` package. You can set the global propagator in code, and should configure the propagator as soon as possible in your application's code.


```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry import propagate
from opentelemetry.propagators.aws import AwsXRayPropagator
propagate.set_global_textmap(AwsXRayPropagator())
```

Alternatively, set the `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` environment variable to achieve the same result.

```
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=xray
```

### Using the AWS resource Detectors

When you install `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws`, you automatically get AWS Resource Detectors in the same package. Use the provided `Resource Detectors` to automatically populate attributes under the `resource` namespace of each generated span.

The ADOT Python SDK supports automatically recording metadata in EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, and EKS environments.

For example, if tracing with OpenTelemetry on an AWS EC2 instance, you can automatically populate `resource` attributes by creating a `TraceProvider` using the `AwsEc2ResourceDetector`:


```python lineNumbers=true
import opentelemetry.trace as trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.resource.ec2 import (
    AwsEc2ResourceDetector,
)
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import get_aggregated_resources

trace.set_tracer_provider(
    TracerProvider(
        resource=get_aggregated_resources(
            [
                AwsEc2ResourceDetector(),
            ]
        ),
    )
)
```

To see what attributes are captured and how to add other resource detectors, refer to each detectors' docstring in the
[OpenTelemetry SDK Extension for AWS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/main/sdk-extension/opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws)
to determine any requirements for that detector.

### Debug Logging

You can expose better debug logging by modifying the log level for the OpenTelemetry packages your application is using.

```python lineNumbers=true
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s",
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
)
```

Additionally, you can provide your own logger that uses the log level you set above.

```python lineNumbers=true
logger = logging.getLogger(__file__)

logger.debug("My debug level log.")
```

## Instrumenting an Application

**Warning: Some instrumentations are not yet stable and the attributes they collect are subject to change until the instrumentation reaches 1.0 stability. It is recommended to pin a specific version of an instrumentation**

OpenTelemetry provides a wide range of instrumentations for popular python libraries such as Flask, Django, Redis, MySQL, PyMongo and many more. Instrumenting a library means that every time the library is used to make or handle a request, that library call is automatically wrapped with a populated span contain the relevant values that were used. Web framework, downstream HTTP, SQL, gRPC, and other requests can all be recorded using OpenTelemetry.

A full list of supported instrumentation packages and configuration instructions can be found on the [OpenTelemetry Python Contrib repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

To enable tracing of the calls made by your package dependencies, you need to import and initialize the relevant `Instrumentor` classes. `Instrumentor`s have individual
initialization requirements, so refer to the `Instrumentor`’s package documentation for configuration details.

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor

# Initialize `Instrumentor` for the `requests` library
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
# Initialize `Instrumentor` for the `flask` web framework
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
```

### Instrumenting the AWS SDK

To install the instrumentation library for the AWS SDK and its dependencies, run the `pip install` command from below which applies to your application. **NOTE:** Since these instrumentations are not yet stable, we recommend installing it at a pinned version.

For instrumenting the `boto` (AWS SDK V2) package:

```bash
$ pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-boto==0.30b1
```

For instrumenting the `boto3` (AWS SDK V3) package (which depends on the `botocore` package):

```bash
$ pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore==0.30b1
```

Instrumenting the AWS SDK is as easy as configuring the `BotoInstrumentor` or `BotocoreInstrumentor` class. This should be done as soon as possible in your application so that subsequent calls using the SDK are wrapped by OpenTelemetry. This give OpenTelemetry the chance to record relevant information used by the SDK at the time of your application's call and export the information as spans.

For instrumenting the `boto` package:

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.boto import BotoInstrumentor

# Initialize `Instrumentor` for the `boto` library
BotoInstrumentor().instrument()
```

For instrumenting the `boto3` package:

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.botocore import BotocoreInstrumentor

# Initialize `Instrumentor` for the `botocore` library
BotocoreInstrumentor().instrument()
```

For more information refer to the upstream documentation for [OpenTelemetry Python boto Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/opentelemetry-instrumentation-boto) or [OpenTelemetry Python botocore Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore).

## Custom Instrumentation

### Creating Custom Spans

You can use custom spans to monitor the performance of internal activities that are not captured by instrumentation libraries. Note that only spans of kind `Server` are converted into X-Ray segments, all other spans are converted into X-Ray subsegments. For more on segments and subsegments, see the [AWS X-Ray developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-segments).

```python lineNumbers=true
import boto3
import json
from opentelemetry import trace

# Get a tracer from the Global Tracer Provider
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("Root Span", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER):
    print('Started a root span')

    # This 'Child Span' will become an X-Ray subsegment.
    with tracer.start_span("Child Span"):

        print('Started a child span')

        ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
        result = ec2_client.describe_instances()

        print('EC2 Describe Instances: ', json.dumps(result, default=str, indent=4))

        return '<h1>Good job! Traces recorded!</h1>'
```

### Adding custom attributes

You can also add custom key-value pairs as attributes onto your spans. Attributes are converted to metadata by default. If you [configure your collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/7bf2266a025425993a233f66c77a0810ab11a78b/exporter/awsxrayexporter#exporter-configuration), you can convert some or all of the attributes to annotations. To read more about X-Ray annotations and metadata see the [AWS X-Ray Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-annotations).

One way to add custom attributes is as follows:

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry import trace

# Get a tracer from the Global Tracer Provider
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span(
    "Root Span",
    kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER) as span:

    print('Started a root span')

    span.set_attribute("my_attribute", "foo")
```

Alternatively, you can do the following:

```python lineNumbers=true
from opentelemetry import trace

# Get a tracer from the Global Tracer Provider
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span(
    "Root Span",
    kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER) as span:

    print('Started a root span')

    current_span = trace.get_current_span()
    current_span.set_attribute("my_attribute", "foo")
```
