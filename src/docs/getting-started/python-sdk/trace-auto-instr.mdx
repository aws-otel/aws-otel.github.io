The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Python (ADOT Python) provides functionality to [OpenTelemetry Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) for use with AWS X-Ray. OpenTelemetry Python supports automatic instrumentation, which instruments your application to gather telemetry data from a diverse set of libraries and frameworks with minimal configuration. This data can then be exported to different back-ends in different formats.

In this tutorial, we will introduce automatic instrumentation using ADOT Python for AWS X-Ray.

## Requirements

Python 3.6+ is required to use OpenTelemetry Python. Check your currently installed Python version using `python3 -V`.
For more information about supported Python versions, see the [OpenTelemetry Python API package on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-api/).

Make sure you have AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) running. To set up the collector, see 
[Getting Started with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

## Getting the SDKs and dependencies

The OpenTelemetry instrumentation package automates much of the on-boarding process. See the package usage later in this documentation.

###  Install instrumentation packages

You will need to install the `opentelemetry-distro` package from PyPi. This automatically installs the `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, and `opentelemetry-instrumentation` packages. `opentelemetry-instrumentation` provides commands to detect, install, and initialize all instrumentation packages supported for your application’s dependencies.

Also, you will want to install `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws` to make traces compatible with AWS X-Ray.

Go to the directory of the application which you want to instrument and run the following commands.

```bash 
$ # Install required packages for instumentation and tracing support for AWS X-Ray
$ pip install opentelemetry-distro[otlp]>=0.22b0 \
              opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws>=0.22b0
# Automatically install supported instrumentors for the application's dependencies
$ opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

### Setting the global propagators

To allow the span context to propagate downstream when the application makes calls to external services, configure the global propagator. 
Set the `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` environment variable to use the AWS X-Ray Propagator.

```
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=aws_xray
```

### Run the application 

Auto instrumentation uses the `opentelemetry-instrument` wrapper executable to automatically initialize the installed instrumentors and start the provided application. Environment variables are used to configure the connection to the ADOT Collector and command line arguments are used to configure trace generation for AWS X-Ray.

The `IdGenerator` can be configured with the environment variables `OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR=aws_xray` or the `opentelemetry-instrument` command line argument `--id-generator=aws_xray`.

The `SpanExporter` can be configured with the environment variables `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp` or the `opentelemetry-instrument` command line argument `--trace-exporter=otlp`. However, if `opentelemetry-distro[otlp]` is used, it already uses the `otlp` exporter by default with any more configuration.

The configuration of your SDK exporter depends on how you have configured your ADOT Collector. To learn more about how the ADOT Collector can be configured, refer to the [ADOT Collector Documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

We can use the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:55678` environment variable to set the address that the exporter will use to connect to the collector. If the address is unset, it will instead try to connect to `localhost:4317`.

If the Collector the application will connect to is running without TLS configured, the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True` environment variable is used to disable client transport security for an SDK OTLP exporter’s connection. This will use the gRPC insecure_channel() method as explained in the [gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=insecure#grpc.insecure_channel). This option should never be used in production, non-sidecar deployments.

If the Collector the application will connect to is running with TLS configured, the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE=/path/to/my-cert.crt` environment variable is used to give a path to credentials to be used to establish a secure connection for the app’s exporter. The credentials at this path should be the public certificate of the collector, or one of its root certificates. If no certificate is found, the gRPC method `ssl_channel_credentials()` will attempt to “retrieve the PEM-encoded root certificates from a default location chosen by gRPC runtime” as explained in the [gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=ssl_channel_credentials).

#### Examples on running the application

Starting an application which connects to a Collector running as a sidecar without TLS:

```bash
$ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 \
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=aws_xray \
OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR=aws_xray \
opentelemetry-instrument python ./path/to/your/app.py
```

Starting an application which connects to a Collector running as a sidecar without TLS using flask:

```bash
$ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 \
FLASK_APP=./my_flask_app.py \
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=aws_xray \
OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR=aws_xray \
opentelemetry-instrument flask run
```

Starting an application which connects to a Collector running as a service with TLS:

```bash
$ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE=/path/to/my-cert.crt \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=collector.service.local \
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=aws_xray \
OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR=aws_xray \
opentelemetry-instrument python ./path/to/your/app.py
```

Custom tracing works the same way when using automatic instrumentation or manual instrumentation. For information about custom trace instrumentation, see our [docs on manual instrumentation](/docs/getting-started/python-sdk/trace-manual-instr).
