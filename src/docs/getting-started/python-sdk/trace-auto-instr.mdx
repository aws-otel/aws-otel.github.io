The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Python (ADOT Python) provides functionality to [OpenTelemetry Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) 
for use with AWS X-Ray. OpenTelemetry Python supports automatic instrumentation, which instruments your application to gather telemetry data from a 
diverse set of libraries and frameworks with minimal configuration. This data can then be exported to different back-ends in different formats.

In this tutorial, we introduce you to how to use the auto-instrumentation package for traces with AWS X-Ray.

## Requirements

Python 3.5+ is required to use OpenTelemetry Python. Check your currently installed Python version using python3 -V.
For more information about supported Python versions, see the [OpenTelemetry Python API package on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-api/).

Make sure you have AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) running. To set up the collector, see 
[Getting Started with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

## Getting the SDKs and dependencies

The OpenTelemetry instrumentation package automates much of the on-boarding process. See the package usage later in this documentation.

###  Install instrumentation packages

You’ll need the `opentelemetry-instrumentation` package from PyPi. This automatically installs the `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk` packages. 
It also provides commands to detect, install, and initialize all instrumentation packages supported for your application’s dependencies.

Go to the directory of the application, which currently imports these packages, and run the following commands.

```bash 
# Install required packages for instumentation and tracing support for AWS X-Ray 
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation==0.16b1
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==0.16b1
pip install opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws==0.16b1
# Automatically install supported instrumentors for the application's dependencies
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

### Run the application 

In a new terminal window, move to the project directory and start the application by entering `opentelemetry-instrument`. This automatically initializes the 
installed instrumentors. Use environment variables to connect to the ADOT Collector and command line arguments to configure use with AWS X-Ray.

We can use the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True` environment variable to disable client transport security for our OTLP exporter’s connection. This setting 
is acceptable when running the application locally and the OTel Collector is expecting traces without using 
[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). However, if connecting to a gRPC server on the internet running gRPC over TLS as is 
the common the case, this setting is not necessary. Read more regarding this on the 
[gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=insecure#grpc.insecure_channel).

Further, we can use the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:55678` environment variable to set the address that the exporter will use to connect 
to the collector. If the address is unset, it will instead try to connect to `localhost:55680`.

An example of starting an application using generic environment variables:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True opentelemetry-instrument -e otlp --ids-generator aws_xray python ./path/to/your/app.py
```

An example of starting an application using flask:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:55678 FLASK_APP=./my_flask_app.py opentelemetry-instrument -e otlp --ids-generator aws_xray flask run
```

Custom tracing works the same way when using automatic instrumentation or manual instrumentation. For information about trace instrumentation, see 
[custom tracing manual instrumentation](/docs/getting-started/python-sdk/trace-manual-instr).
