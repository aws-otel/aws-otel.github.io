The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Python (ADOT Python) provides functionality to [OpenTelemetry Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) 
for use with AWS X-Ray. OpenTelemetry Python supports automatic instrumentation, which instruments your application to gather telemetry data from a 
diverse set of libraries and frameworks with minimal configuration. This data can then be exported to different back-ends in different formats.

In this tutorial, we introduce you to how to use the auto-instrumentation package for traces with AWS X-Ray.

## Requirements

Python 3.5+ is required to use OpenTelemetry Python. Check your currently installed Python version using python3 -V.
For more information about supported Python versions, see the [OpenTelemetry Python API package on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-api/).

Make sure you have AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT Collector) running. To set up the collector, see 
[Getting Started with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector).

## Getting the SDKs and dependencies

The OpenTelemetry instrumentation package automates much of the on-boarding process. See the package usage later in this documentation.

###  Install instrumentation packages

You’ll need the `opentelemetry-instrumentation` package from PyPi. This automatically installs the `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk` packages. 
It also provides commands to detect, install, and initialize all instrumentation packages supported for your application’s dependencies.

Go to the directory of the application, which currently imports these packages, and run the following commands.

```bash 
# Install required packages for instumentation and tracing support for AWS X-Ray 
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation==0.16b1
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==0.16b1
pip install opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws==0.16b1
# Automatically install supported instrumentors for the application's dependencies
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

### Setting the global propagators

To allow the span context to propagate downstream when the application makes calls to external services, configure the global propagator. 
Set the `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` environment variable to use to the AWS X-Ray Propagator.

```
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=aws_xray
```

Alternatively, you can set the global propagator in code. Configure the propagator before your code starts, as shown below.

```python lineNumbers=true 
from opentelemetry import propagators
from opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.trace.propagation.aws_xray_format import AwsXRayFormat

propagators.set_global_textmap(AwsXRayFormat())
```

### Run the application 

Auto instrumentation uses the `opentelemetry-instrument` wrapper executable to automatically initialize the installed instrumentors 
and start the provided application. Environment variables are used to configure the connection to the ADOT Collector and command 
line arguments are used to configure trace generation for AWS X-Ray.

    <mark>
        Please note, we do not recommend using the insecure option. Rather, we recommend configuring either a public or private
        certificate to authenticate your session before running your application.
    </mark>
</div>

The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True` environment variable is used to disable client transport security for an OTLP 
exporter’s connection. This will use the gRPC insecure_channel() method as explained in the 
[gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=insecure#grpc.insecure_channel). 
This option should never be used in production, non-sidecar deployments.

If connecting to a gRPC server on the internet running gRPC over TLS, the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE=/path/to/cert.pem` environment 
variable can be used to give a path to credentials to be used to establish a secure connection for the app’s exporter. The credentials 
at this path should be the public certificate of the collector, or one of its root certificates. If no certificate is found, the 
gRPC method `ssl_channel_credentials()` will attempt to “retrieve the PEM-encoded root certificates from a default 
location chosen by gRPC runtime” as explained in the [gRPC Python Documentation](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html?highlight=ssl_channel_credentials).

Further, we can use the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:55678` environment variable to set the address that the exporter will use to connect 
to the collector. If the address is unset, it will instead try to connect to `localhost:55680`.

An example of starting an application using generic environment variables:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True opentelemetry-instrument -e otlp --ids-generator aws_xray python ./path/to/your/app.py
```

An example of starting an application using flask:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=True OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:55678 FLASK_APP=./my_flask_app.py opentelemetry-instrument -e otlp --ids-generator aws_xray flask run
```

Custom tracing works the same way when using automatic instrumentation or manual instrumentation. For information about trace instrumentation, see 
[custom tracing manual instrumentation](/docs/getting-started/python-sdk/trace-manual-instr).
